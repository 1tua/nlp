  That was not the case, either pre or post-Covid, among a range of other occupations representing between half and two-thirds of the workforce
 In this respect, Covid has not only accelerated pre-existing trends towards home-working; it has also widened pre-existing occupational divides between those who can and cannot exercise the option of home-working
  The Effects on Productivity and Output Given these shifts, some of which seem likely to prove durable, what impact might they have had on workers’ and businesses’ economic contribution – that is to say, their productivity (the amount done per hour worked) and their overall output (productivity multiplied by working hours)? In short, how has this shift in working practices affected working capacity of the economy? A number of empirical studies have looked at the effects of home working on productivity
 Even if the amount workers produce each hour has fallen, as evidence and anecdote tentatively suggests, this need not imply workers’ overall economic contribution has fallen
  Studies of the length of the working day – measured by the time between the first and last email being sent – point to a larger effect still, with close to an 8% rise in working hours as a result of home-working
 Studies prior to the Covid crisis estimated that between a third and a half of the tasks we do in the office could effectively be done at home
footnote[16] With between a third and a half of the workforce home-working, the Covid crisis has taken us to that point, involuntarily, at warp speed
 Well-being matters, both in its own right but also because there is a fairly well-established link between peoples’ sense of satisfaction and their productivity in the workplace
 The Covid crisis may inadvertently have fast-forwarded us to a better-way-of-working, perhaps even back-to-a-future where most work takes place in and around the house rather than in an office or factory, as was the case prior to the Industrial Revolution
 Those informal between-meetings conversations are, in my experience, the bedrock of relationship-building and the key to trust–building
  I always knew that I picked up a lot of information from the unscheduled time between meetings, when informal and sometimes chance conversations take place
 And the past six months have certainly depleted my social capital: I do not feel I know anyone at work better than six months ago and most a little less well
 Whether this change is for the better is one of the key questions of our time, as workers, businesses, policymakers and citizens
 There is a balance to be struck between events which distract and events which fire the imagination
 My time of the Bank has been evenly split between its twin statutory functions, monetary and financial stability
 Nothing illustrates this better than the revolution in the UK’s monetary and financial stability frameworks during my tenure
 Although decisions on interest rates still resided with politicians, the Bank now had a betterinformed voice
 That voice became louder as a result of two great leaps forward in monetary policy transparency: the publication by the Bank, from 1993 onwards, of a quarterly Inflation Report; and the publication of monthly minutes of the meetings between the Chancellor and Governor at which monetary policy was decided – the “Ken and Eddie Show”
 While MPC procedures have evolved for the better, and the standard of presentations I now receive is far-higher than those I used to give, the foundations of the MPC have remained essentially unmoved
 For UK households these amount to over £200 billion and for UK companies around £100 billion
 This, however, came at one obvious cost: it severed, institutionally, any link between the micro and macro, the brain and the hands
 Advanced economies, it was thought, knew better
 Working alongside HM Treasury colleagues (including Sir Jon Cunliffe – another whose path I have lost track of), an intensive programme of international reform began Page 10 with the aim of preventing a repetition of these emerging market crises
 In 2002, I was asked by Tim Geithner (now at the IMF) to go to Washington to work on international financial system design, alongside two former US Treasury colleagues, Nouriel Roubini (now better known as Dr Doom) and Brad Setser
 With hindsight, I think Stan Fischer was right on the need for a better-resourced IMF, alongside the international equivalent of a resolution authority for nation states
 The more connected the system’s nodes – the larger the number of “super-spreaders” - the greater this fragility
 In avoiding fragility, one effective solution was to ring-fence activities, the financial equivalent of fire-breaks, to contain contagion
 A second solution was to focus on inoculating, or risk-proofing, the superspreaders to prevent them serving as a conduit for contagion
 It demonstrated that, in a world of uncertainty as distinct from risk, it is better to be super-safe ex-ante than super-sorry ex-post, better to be roughly right than precisely wrong
 To this day, I believe that if greater amounts had been injected then – perhaps £100 billion? - UK banks would have been more willing to lend and the recovery would have been less anaemic
 It would have been better to be super-safe ex-ante than super-sorry ex-post
 Although these regulatory reforms eventually fell short of my up-front ambitions in their scale and scope, they nonetheless moved the system to a decisively better place
[21] The Basel 3 reforms eventually resulted in significant increases in the amounts of capital banks held; the introduction of an international regime for leverage and liquidity; a capital surcharge for the world’s “super-spreader” banks; and a system of countercyclical capital regulation to modulate credit cycles
 Second, as important as the resilience of the financial system was its interaction with the macro-economy to avoid adverse feedback effects between the two, such as credit crunches
 In a paper prepared for the Jackson Hole central banking shindig in 2012, I questioned whether the very complexity of financial regulation might have contributed to the increasing fragility of the financial system
 In the UK, the Vickers Commission reforms created a fire-break between banks’ services to the domestic economy and their other activities
 Crisis needed to be the catalyst for change, forging a link between the Bank’s analytical brain and its regulatory hands
 As other countries have found, the scale and scope created by a Development Bank is necessary to reach SME start-ups and scale-ups across all sectors and all regions
 And that is why a deeper consideration of monetary and financial stability implications is paramount today
 Transparency is necessary for central bank success, but not sufficient
 If you study the linguistic complexity of central bank publications, you find they are readily accessible to only between 5-10% of the population
 Reading between the lines, I am not sure they liked it
 Like many public institutions, central banks have historically been better at talking than listening, better at public understanding than understanding the public
 The aim of any job is to leave the place slightly better than when you arrived
 The Bank is unrecognisably better than the institution I joined
 Like those new Bank graduates, this old one could not have wished for a better endowment
 Some degree of caution is desirable - in how we socialise, shop and work - to prevent the spread of this awful disease
 But we need at the same time to prevent healthy caution morphing into fear and fatalism
 Economists call the relationship between demand and jobs Okun’s Law
 The better news is that the economy began its recovery from this dramatic fall earlier, and has since recovered far-faster, than anyone expected
 Even if our GDP nowcasts for August and September come to pass, there remains an average recession-sized gap between output and its pre-Covid level
 Job losses have continued to mount (though the Bank revised down its estimate of job losses by around 720,000 between May and August)
 Put differently, the historical correlation between consumer confidence and spending appears to have broken down (Chart 3)
 A wedge has emerged between peoples’ expectations and their spending, between their risk perceptions and economic reality
 The misery index also suggests some wedge has opened up between public perceptions and policymaker expectations for the economy
 Even during that earlier period, we saw significant substitution between spending categories, partially insulating aggregate spending
 This is another example of the wedge between public and policymaker expectations
 The MPC has also made clear that it stands ready to take whatever further action is needed to support the economy and return inflation sustainably to target, should that prove necessary
 The operational work necessary to assess the feasibility of negative rates is likely to take a number of months
 For its part, the MPC has committed to keeping borrowing costs at current extraordinarily low levels to support jobs and incomes for as long as necessary to return inflation to target
 Other definitions of recovery would of course suggest different amounts/periods of job creation, but it remains true that the current phase of job creation is high by historical standards
 Changes between post-crisis peak and latest data in Labour Force Statistics
 As elsewhere, this boost has been largest at the higher-skill (such as managers and directors) and lower-skill (such as elementary occupations) ends of the occupational spectrum, with the mid-skilled benefitting least

 In the ten years prior to the crisis, all regions experienced annual rises in real pay, averaging between 1
 Comparing the past 10 years as a whole, real pay today is lower at every point along the wage distribution and, with the exception of the bottom decile, by broadly similar amounts of around 5% (Chart 10)
 The Jobs Ladder The framework most often used by macro-economists to explain pay and jobs is the Phillips curve – the negative relationship between pay growth and the stock of unemployment
12 An alternative, complementary, lens on the labour market comes from looking at flows of workers between jobs, rather than stocks of unemployed
 In a growing economy, workers move between jobs by climbing a ladder of opportunities based on job characteristics such as relative rates of pay and firm productivity
 15,16  More productive firms are better able to offer higher rates of pay
 Between 2008 Q1 and 2009 Q2, UK output fell by around 6 ¼%, while unemployment rose by just over 2 ½ percentage points
 Instead of moving between jobs, workers instead transitioned into unemployment
 In response, workers began to climb the jobs ladder, with transition rates between jobs rising
 The Resolution Foundation has recently looked at rates of movement between UK regions
uk/speeches 19 19 Charts 21 and 22 look at rates of worker transition between different industries and occupations
 Notes: Chart shows percentage difference in productivity between new firm and old firm with the median workers moves between firms
 Almost 300 global trade agreements were reached between 1950 and 2018 (Chart 24)
 Global goods trade volumes grew, on average, by 10% per year between 1950 and 2008
 24  After a prolonged period of peace, trade wars are now being waged: tariffs have been introduced on over $200 billion of bilateral goods trade between the US and China; further US-China tariffs are threatened; and there are ongoing trade tensions between the US and Mexico and the US and Europe
 We now have a much better sense of why: closely inter-connected global markets, once disrupted by deep uncertainty, can cause contagious collapses in confidence, output and asset prices as participants take precautionary action through fight or flight
 Notes: Line thickness is proportional to total goods trade between regions
 Most recently, the perceived risk of a “no deal” Brexit has risen, with betting odds placing a roughly 30% probability on that event, double the probability earlier this year
 Companies were asked ‘Relative to the last 12 months, what is the likely impact on the following for your business over the next year in each scenario: a deal and transition period and no deal and no transition period?’ For each relevant business factor, respondents were asked to choose between ‘Fall greater than 10%’; ‘-10 to -2%’; ‘Little change’; ‘+2 to +10%’ and ‘Rise greater than 10%’
 The correlation of daily changes between them has been around 0
 But what stands out, for me, are the differences as much as the similarities between the UK, US and euro-area economies
 You might expect a negative relationship between the two: the lower unemployment, the smaller slack in the economy and the higher the level of real interest rates necessary to prevent inflation rising
 The crisis led to a large gap opening-up between aggregate demand and supply in the economy
 According to our Decision Maker Panel, investment among UK companies is estimated to be between 6-14% lower, and firms’ Total Factor Productivity (TFP) around 2-5% lower
 Trust lies at the heart of the social contract between institutions and societies, between policymakers and citizens
 Nonetheless, it seems clear that increased engagement between policymakers and wider society is a necessary ingredient for its manufacture
 I find that cartoons can be particularly effective, indeed much better than words, in capturing the sentiment and narrative in the room
 16  The date that real GDP returned to its pre-crisis peak has changed between different vintages of ONS data and was originally thought to have occurred in 2014
 For some, that made for a stark choice between “heating or eating”
 The aim is to establish, in a structured, systematic and comprehensive way, a two-way dialogue and collaboration between the Bank and a panel of citizen representatives on the economy, financial system and policy, as a means of enhancing the understanding of both parties
 There is a demand for better public understanding of the economy from the public themselves
5 If we turn from economics to finance, the picture is no better
 There are over 12 million people in the UK who feel they do not have the information they need to choose wisely between insurance products
33 The link between debt, financial illiteracy and mental health is clearly two-way
 This tipping point in expectations provides a plausible account of the cliff-edge fall in GDP at the time of the Great Recession, the Great Depression and several episodes in between
 But if doing so delivers the desired policy outcome – building public confidence to support spending – that may be the better side of the line on which to err
 When someone tells you that a higher cost of living is, for them, the choice between heating and eating, it makes everyday economics real
52  My own work in schools, and recent research by the Bank, has confirmed encouragingly high levels of interest and enthusiasm among children and young adults in better understanding the economy
 Only 12% of the population studies maths between the ages of 16-18
53  The statistics here tell an ugly story, with 17 million adults in the UK having numeracy skills no better than those expected of a primary school child
 As a result, in 2016/17 only just over 9,000 students across the UK studied GCSE economics, typically between the ages of 14 and 16
 Around 33,000 students completed A-Level economics in the UK in 2016/17, typically studying between the ages 16 to 18
 The fraction of students from London studying economics between ages 14 and 18 is roughly twice the national average
 At those points, a trusting and understanding relationship between the central bank and the public matters
 It was said that central bankers, like faith, were better understood by their deeds than by their words
 A century ago, public utterances by the Governor of the Bank of England amounted to one after-dinner speech each year to a well-watered set of City of London bankers
 Heroically, attempts were made by some academics to rationalise this monetary mystique as a necessary means of central banks exerting influence over the economy
 Establishing a central bank has increasingly been seen as an essential building block of nation state-building, a crucial element in the fabric of democratic statecraft
 Doing so would, I believe, leave central banks even better-informed and better-placed to deliver their core mandates in future
 The better those individual decisions (the micro), the more stable the economy and financial system are likely to be (the macro)
 An improved understanding could result in better-informed popular narratives, and more stable expectations, among the general
 Nonetheless, Chart 3 suggests that, in a complex forecasting task, there is little to choose between experts and non-experts
 How much would that have improved its forecasts over the sample period? The gap in two year-ahead forecast errors between the MPC and the best external forecaster in the panel of outside forecasters is around ¼ percentage point
 Now let’s choose a complex, and topical, question: will Artificial Intelligence (AI) cause mass unemployment? It is well-known that the views of experts (and non-experts) differ widely on this complex  38  The conditioning assumptions (such as the assumed path of interest rates) and purpose of forecasts will vary between central banks and other forecasters
 Figure 2 plots the relationship between insight and the numbers of people providing information in a group, in stylised terms
 The two corner solutions – the “Oracle” (single person) and the “Madness of Crowds” (population) – involve very different trade-offs between diversity and deliberation
 But it was notable in seeking to strike a balance between the two features subsequent research has shown to be crucial for effective, representative decision-making in complex environments: diversity and deliberation
 Interestingly, these seek to strike a rather different balance between diversity and deliberation, both relative to the Athenian model and especially relative to each other
 Citizens’ panels or juries have been used to tackle such varied issues as voting reform (in Canada), gay rights (Ireland), reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous communities (Australia), nuclear power (South Korea), membership of the euro (Denmark) and environmental pollution (United States)
 Understanding is a necessary but not sufficient condition for trust-building
 There are a number of elements
 How do you ensure as wide, diverse and representative a set of citizens as possible? How do you engage citizens who might not understand or trust the Bank? How much time needs to be set aside to enable the deliberative process to be fruitful? And how many people should you engage to get the balance right between diversity and deliberation? We are working with a range of partners, including the RSA, to come up with answers
 Colin David Finch built his brilliant academic and professional career on nurturing international co-operation on economic and financial matters: in his studies here at the University of Melbourne and at the London School of Economics; in his long and distinguished time at the International Monetary Fund; and, in later life, at the Institute for International Economics in Washington DC
 One of the key policy challenges ahead will be to prevent the hard-won gains from global integration and co-operation being lost
 5  Meanwhile, QE is held by some to have increased inequalities between rich and poor and to have harmed pension funds and the companies sponsoring them
 6 Some have gone further, suggesting that QE may have caused central banks to cross the thin line between monetary and fiscal policy, between economic policy and political economy
 This is done in both standard units of measurement (money amounts and percentages) and in non-standard units (welfare and well-being)
 Indeed, the  4  QE calculated with reference to combined purchases by US, UK, euro-area and Japanese central banks between start-2007 and end-2017
 Some policies redistribute resources between agents at a point in time
 Others redistribute resources between agents over time
 But neutrality applies, with no less force, to the distribution of resources in the economy, whether between sectors or regions
 The latter have objectives which are often explicitly distributional and their instruments are better-equipped to achieve such redistribution
 For example, changes in interest rates redistribute interest payments between savers and borrowers at any point in time
 They also affect, over time, the balance between saving and borrowing in the economy
 Central bank asset purchases potentially affect differently those with assets and those with debt, as well as affecting the balance between asset and debt-holding over time
 For example, when interest rates change it is important to gauge not only how cash flow switches between savers and borrowers, but whether it is being saved or spent
 It can help preserve that all-important social contract between policymakers and citizens
19  Specifically, we focus on a fixed panel of 10,000 households across 4 waves of this survey between 2006-08 and 2012-14
5%) between February 2008 and March 2009; and second, the purchase of £375 billion of government securities between March 2009 and mid-2012
 This impact is shown on both a “money amount” and “percentage of income” basis
 26  These effects are also split between the “cash flow” and “labour income” channels
 27 If we look at money amounts, rather than percentages, the balance of benefits is significantly more uneven
 26  The ‘money amount’ numbers that follow in this section refer to real income, defined in 2013 prices
 This was prompted, in part, by the large perception gap between the public’s view of how taxes were being spent and their true destination – a perception gap similar, but smaller, than for monetary policy
 This would identify the channels and the amounts by which a significant change in monetary policy affected people’s finances (income, wealth) and wider well-being (employment and financial security)
45  On a broad estimate, this annual cost amounts to around £2
 A disaggregated analysis can be used to help decompose the ways and means and amounts by which different sets of households have been affected by monetary policy
 It would seek better to explain how monetary policy is affecting your job, your cost of living, your GDP
3 That makes growth a gift, one necessary (if not necessarily sufficient) to deliver secular improvements in living standards
 I think this story carries important implications for understanding the future challenges of technology and for devising the future policies and institutions necessary to meet them
 It has meant each generation has been around 50% better off than its predecessor
uk/speeches 4 4 A Story with One “i” What explains this extra-ordinary inflexion point in the history of economic growth and living standards? So fundamental is this question to so much of social and economic history that, understandably, it has attracted huge amounts of empirical, historical, social and theoretical research
 This fruit has been shared roughly equally between owners of companies (profits) and workers in companies (wages)
 Some of you will remember the sequence from Monty Python’s The Life of Brian which begins with the rhetorical question: “What did the Romans ever do for us?” The sketch concludes: “But apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order
 In other words, while ideas and innovation may well be a necessary condition  14  Van Reenen et al (2010), for example, document the economic impact of ICT
 Between 1300 and 1700, GDP expanded slightly more than half the time
 Where does this leave our story of growth? Well, the story that better fits the facts appears to be one in which the conveyor belt of ideas and innovation has been continuous over the centuries, causing lengthy if lumpy ideas-fuelled expansions
 A number of distinguished economists have, over the years, placed institutions centre-stage in explaining secular trends in social and economic development
 For children between the ages of 5 and 10, this was formally introduced in the UK with the Elementary Education Act of 1880
 The fraction of the population aged 15 and over that attended secondary school rose from 23% to 60% between 1950 and 2010
 That provided the human capital necessary to turn new technologies and machines into higher levels of productivity among companies, higher wages among workers and, ultimately, higher living standards among societies
 And this, ultimately, was the difference between the living standards escalator of the Golden Era and the travellator of its Malthusian predecessor
 But if history is any guide, the story of growth will hinge on the interplay between the two “i”s – the disruptive forces of innovation on the one hand, the stabilising role of institutions on the other
 49  The estimates of gross job loss span a pretty wide range, but lie anywhere between 10% and 50% of the global workforce, depending on whether it is jobs or tasks that are assumed to be displaced (Table 1 summarises)
 If the truth lies in between, this could still make the jobs loss from the Fourth Industrial Revolution greater than its predecessors
 Indeed, it is possible the balance between cognitive and social skills might alter significantly even among jobs which traditionally have been cognitively-intense
61  In future, that balance between social and clinical skills may shift further
 Rather, they are likely to be more evenly balanced between the cognitive, technical and social – head, hands and heart
 Other things equal, this should have accelerated catch-up between countries operating at and inside the technological frontier
 They suggest that, over time, there has been a divergence between frontier and non-frontier countries
 This will have retarded catch-up between the two blocs
 This has shown up in levels of productivity between frontier and non-frontier which, since around 1980, have if anything diverged
 And the widening dispersion in productivity performance between the upper and lower tails of companies helps explain the UK’s relatively poorer productivity performance than these countries over the past decade
 And between 2009 and 2016, the share of UK businesses making e-commerce sales increased by only 6pp, from 17% to 23%
 Each year, they engage in between 6,000-8,000 projects, large and small, with companies
 For example, Faijgelbaum and Khandelwal (2016) estimate that global trade integration has lowered the price of the typical household consumption basket by between a quarter and two-thirds – a huge effect
 Interestingly, the relationship between broad money growth and money spending growth – the velocity of circulation of broad money – remained relatively stable following the global financial crisis (Chart 10)
 By design, these have broken the link between the demand for workers by firms and the unemployment rate

 Exceptional amounts of central bank money have once again been created during the Covid crisis to maintain borrowing costs at low levels
15 Globally, the amount of QE undertaken during the crisis is already rapidly catching-up with the amount undertaken during the prior ten-year period
 My topic today echoes many of the themes SPERI has championed – the role of local perspectives and policies in better understanding the economy and in shaping a better society
 Does the O’Neill hypothesis hold for our economies too? Is all economics local? Are our economies better understood as a nation-state solid or as a set of loosely-linked local clusters? Might this have implications for how we map, model and manage the economy? And might it even have implications for central banks, despite their policies operating nationally rather than locally? I want to explore these questions, tentatively and provisionally, first by drawing some simple maps of the economy at different spatial resolutions
 How large are differences between-region? How do they compare with differences within-region? And what do we know about flows of factors, including people, between and within regions? This local lens poses some interesting questions about how the economy should be modelled
 Even then, however, a local perspective can be important for better understanding the economic issues people face and for building understanding and trust among those people
 Economic policymakers, including central banks, have a pivotal role to play in resurrecting that Third Pillar, in making economic policy local, to better support our economies and societies
 This means some areas shrink (such as Scotland) while others expand (such as London) even without differences between them
 (a) Differences between regions To fix ideas, Charts 1a and 1b plot a map and an accompanying cartogram of population by region in the UK and, by way of comparison, Germany
 10  Put differently, the correlation between geographic area size and population in the UK is in fact slightly negative (-0
 The gap between richest and poorest region is around 150%
 For wealth per household, the North-South divide is also large, with a gap between richest and poorest of 130%
 The gap between richest and poorest regions in the UK is almost twice as large as in France and three-quarters larger than in Germany
 The gap between highest and lowest life expectancies regionally is around 3
uk/speeches 13 13 While simple, these maps suggest there is important information on economies and societies to be found by peering through different lenses: lenses that operate at different resolutions, as the striking UK regional differences in income, wealth and health demonstrate; and lenses that focus on different economic attributes, as the striking differences between the UK’s regional income and well-being maps demonstrate
uk/speeches 14 14 comparing them within and between regions? Or are these patterns self-similar at different resolutions, as when we use a microscope to study the shoreline? Chart 9 provides one visualisation of these patterns at different resolutions
 If between-region income differences were much larger than within-region differences, we would expect the violin to be much longer on its left than on its right hand side
 The distributions of income within and between regions are in fact quite similar, at both the NUTS 2 and 3 levels
 If anything, the distribution of outcomes within each region appears to be a little larger than the distribution between regions
 If anything, income inequalities within a region appear to be larger than income inequalities between regions
 For health and well-being, differences within a region or local authority are materially larger than differences between regions
 The difference between the highest and lowest life expectancy among UK local authorities is 12 years, or 15% of the average expected lifespan
 Even more striking are the differences in the same city, however, with adjacent districts reporting bad health differences of between 3% and 25%
 What do we know about interactions among the economy’s moving parts? (c) Movements between regions In economic systems, interactions occur among all of the factors involved in production and consumption decisions – people, money, goods and services
 Even gross inflows and outflows are relatively modest, varying between 4% (London) and ½% (Northern Ireland)

 25  While it is heterogeneity that is often emphasized, it is interactions between agents that is most important for replicating real-world dynamics
io/anon/pen/XQLNaZ HANK-type models do a better job of capturing heterogeneity across agents than their RANK cousins
 They pose difficult choices, such as where to strike the balance between realism (complexity) and parsimony (simplicity)
 But computers these days can keep track far better than any human
 The data necessary to calibrate these digital twins is considerable, but also increasingly commonplace
 This not only helps people better understand the environment facing them
 Micro-level data, digital twins and massive-scale simulations are being used to better understand all manner of other systems at all manner of resolutions – from the sub-atomic scale when seeking the Higgs-Boson, to the global scale when modelling flows across oceans, the world wide web and galaxies
 And by smoothing-out aggregate fluctuations, diverse economic areas can help smooth out local fluctuations by transferring resources between regions to insure against region-specific shocks
 Some of these agglomeration benefits may themselves arise from having a diverse economic eco-system, as this enables positive spillovers between sectors and skills within an area
 Easy movement of factors between regions can smooth-out differences between regions
 In this way, factor mobility can serve as a risk-sharing device between areas, even without policy intervention
 Factor mobility can sometimes increase, rather than smooth out, differences between regions
54 One of the interesting features of these empirical ECIs is that they appear to match the theory: the greater the degree of specialisation and diversity, and the higher the ECI, the better the economic outcome
 And a better mutual understanding between communities and central banks would, in turn, help build trust between them
61  They are a direct conversation between the Bank and the public, typically on local economic and financial issues
 I believe our economic policies would be better able to serve the public, and better understood by them, if we could do so
   The topic for this panel is the link between developments in product markets and monetary policy
 A lot of attention has been paid by central bankers over recent years to the relationship between labour markets and monetary policy (for example, Yellen (2014) and Constâncio (2017))
 The relationship between monetary policy and product markets has, by comparison, been the road less travelled
 And they may have influenced the amount of investment and innovation undertaken by firms and hence the aggregate demand curve (Aghion et al (2005))
 And it may also potentially alter the optimal weights placed on output and inflation stabilisation by the policymaker, shifting the point of tangency between the policy possibility frontier and policymakers’ loss function (C to D)
 The apparent puzzle between the micro-economic and macro-economic evidence deserves further research, given its potential impact on inflation dynamics and monetary policy
 With non-homogenous goods and non-Cournot competition, a better measure of market power is often provided by firms’ mark-ups – the ratio of their price to their marginal cost (De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018))
 Though there is cross-country variation, average mark-ups have risen significantly in every G7 country, by between 30 and 150 percentage points
 According to Table 1, mark-ups will have been adding, on average, over one percentage point each year to measured inflation rates across the G7 countries between 1980 and 2016, other things equal
9  To better understand some of the drivers of higher mark-ups, it is useful to look at more granular data
 Although they capture subtly different dimensions of market power, there is a weakly positive relationship between measures of mark-up and market concentration at the sector level (Chart 4), which is statistically  6  De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) use a dataset that largely includes publicly-traded companies, but there are also some privately held firms
 This distributional effect can also be seen from the large and widening gap between mean and median mark-ups (Chart 9)
  11  While the positive unconditional correlation between average firm-level mark-ups and concentration at the sector level shown in Chart 4 is not statistically significant, a regression of individual firm-level mark-ups on market concentration in their sector (at the two-digit SIC level) shows a statistically significant positive relationship when we include firm and time fixed effects
 The relationship between mark-ups and productivity is vital in understanding their macro-economic effects (Van Reenen (2018))
 For example, Aghion et al (2005) develop a model which generates a concave relationship between competition and investment
uk/speeches 8 8 De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) document a negative relationship between mark-ups and the capital share among global companies
 And Díez et al (2018) identify empirically a concave relationship between mark-ups and investment, in line with Aghion et al (2005)
 The same relationship holds between mark-ups and R&D expenditure (Table 2, column 2)
 If we look at the relationship between productivity and mark-ups across UK-listed firms, there is evidence of a positive relationship with TFP but no significant relationship with labour productivity (Table 2, columns 3 and 4)
 A second relationship explored recently is between market power and the labour share
 And Díez et al (2018) and De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) identify a weakly negative relationship between  15  The relationship between labour, capital and profit shares is discussed in Barkai (2017)
 If we run regressions similar to those in Díez et al for UK-listed companies (Table 3), we also find a negative relationship between mark-ups and the labour share
 Monetary policy is caught between loosening to return output to potential and tightening to return inflation to target
 Put differently, a sequence of trade-off inducing mark-up shocks would tend to worsen the trade-off between output and inflation variability, for a given monetary policy rule
 𝑃𝑡 and 𝑌𝑡 are the overall price level and aggregate demand at time 𝑡, respectively, while 𝜖 is the elasticity of substitution between the monopolistically competitive products
 By implication, there is no strategic interaction between firms
 Firms can set prices above marginal costs because of a finite elasticity of substitution between individual goods in consumer preferences, regardless of the fact that their share of the total market is small
 Chart 16 looks at the relationship between the slope of the Phillips curve, 𝜅 and mark-ups, 𝜇, for a given parameterisation of the model
 24  Consistent with that, and taken at face value, there is a positive correlation between estimates of the US natural rate of interest and (the inverse) of global mark-ups since 1980 (Chart 17)
uk/speeches 16 16 This tells us that, once the dust has settled, the degree of market power in steady state is all that matters for monetary policymakers in our simple framework when choosing the optimal trade-off between inflation and the output gap
 This makes it optimal to do a greater amount of (now less costly) output-smoothing in the face of trade-off inducing shocks in the optimal policy rule
 Chart 18 plots the relationship between it and mark-ups
 This is a reasonably significant shift in the terms of trade between inflation and output variability
 Chart 20 uses the same calibration, but looks at the relationship between inflation and interest rate variability
 Chart 21 plots the relationship between mark-ups and the inflation bias implied by the model
 The empirical link between market power and productivity is not, at present, well-defined
 Implications for Future Research The link between the competitive structure of product markets, the macro-economy and the setting of monetary policy is a relatively under-researched area
 In practice, strategic interactions between firms are likely to be important in many markets, especially network markets (for example, Bramoullé, Kranton and D’Amours (2014)), with potentially important implications for pricing and the Phillips curve
 Finally, the apparent puzzle between the secular rise in mark-ups at the firm level on the one hand, and relatively low and stable aggregate inflation on the other hand, could usefully be reconciled
 This means the tightening of credit conditions  2  In practice borrowing behaviour is likely to be driven by several other factors, such as expectations of future earnings, access to finance and the amount of collateral with which to borrow against
 This further widens the income gap between Red Car and Blue Car regions
 So although both regions are better off in net wealth terms, Blue Car region benefits more than Red Car region
 5  According to data from Eurostat (2016), the gap in GDP per head between the richest and poorest regions in the UK ranked fourth in a sample of 20 EU countries on a comparable PPP adjusted basis in 2014
6  This means there is a close correspondence between the regional distribution of GDP per head and wages per household (Chart 2)
 One important determinant of a firm’s efficiency is the amount it invests in machines and technology - its physical capital stock
5% between September 2008 and March 2009 by the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
 This was augmented with £375billion of asset purchases between 2009 and 2012, almost exclusively in government securities
 In interest-rate equivalent terms, this amounted to a monetary stimulus worth around 7 percentage points
 But they have since fallen across every region in the UK since 2011 and by roughly similar amounts, on average 3 percentage points (Chart 12a)
 Net wealth is assumed to move in line with nominal GDP, and no distinction is made between the various different types of wealth (such as housing or financial wealth)
 Comparing Charts 2 and 15, there is little correlation between levels of wages and the change in them over recent years
 It is unclear at present how the disconnect between the relative optimism of households and some companies, on the one hand, and the relative pessimism of financial market players and the other half of companies, on the other, will be reconciled
 Over five years, the incremental spending amounts to an extra £23 billion
 This pattern of productivities goes some way towards explaining, at least in an arithmetic sense, the large and widening divergence between regional levels of productivity
 It also begs the question of what is preventing the diffusion of processes and technologies used in one firm to other firms operating in a similar region or sector
 As a member of the Bank of England’s Court between 2003 and 2012, Brendan’s insights on the labour market and wider economy were crucial in helping the Bank steer a policy course through a period of first macroeconomic calm and then extra-ordinary macroeconomic storm following the global financial crisis
 For example, there is a striking correlation between the pattern of unemployment and wage growth in the UK and the US (Charts 3 and 4)
 In the 1950s, A W Phillips uncovered a negative empirical relationship between pay growth and unemployment: pay grows faster when unemployment is lower
 As an illustration, Charts 6 and 7 plot the relationship between wage growth and unemployment in the UK and the US over three sample periods dating back to the 1970s
 In the end, workers are interested in the purchasing power of their pay, not its money amount
 The regressions in Table 1 use inflation expectations as they give a slightly better empirical fit
uk/speeches 5 5 A second key determinant of wage growth is unemployment or, more precisely, the gap between unemployment and its longer-run trend (sometimes called the NAIRU or Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment)
 5 There are various measures of under-employment, including the proportion of the workforce working part-time involuntarily and the gap between actual and desired hours worked
 The Phillips curve plots the relationship between the stock of unemployed and wage growth
 Another strand of the labour market literature has looked instead at flows of people into and out of work and the associated process of job-matching between employers and employees
7  In these models, pay is determined by flows of workers between jobs, and by the relative bargaining strength of employees and employers, as well as by fluctuations in labour demand and supply
 A rise in job insecurity will reduce flows of workers between jobs and their bargaining strength
uk/speeches 8 8 A more stripped-down measure of the labour share, which better tracks workers’ purchasing power, is wages and salaries (Chart 12)
 When workers exercise the outside option of moving between jobs, this puts upward pressure on pay through two main channels
 As with under-employment, in a statistical horse-race between the two measures the unemployment gap does slightly more of the donkey work
 Flows between jobs also provide a useful framework through which to explain recent pay developments
 16  A second implication of structurally lower pay power is that there is greater scope for employers to differentiate between workers in their pay awards
 They have been joined recently by a further 1 million workers from the armed forces, police and teachers, who have secured pay rises of between 2-3
 On the cyclical side, there remains a significant degree of uncertainty around the amount of slack in the economy
5 percentage points per year, as a result of the failure fully to capture elements of the digital economy
 A third channel through which the crisis might have slowed productivity is by hindering resource reallocation between firms and across sectors
15  Flows of capital and labour between companies are one of the key channels through which technology and ideas are diffused
16  Since the crisis, rates of labour market churn between companies have been low and the dispersion in rates of return across sectors has been high
 By supporting low-productivity companies who would otherwise have failed, policy actions may have prevented the “creative destruction” of firms
29  For example, recent empirical work by the OECD has highlighted the possibility of the technological diffusion engine having slowed, or even stalled, over the most recent period, with a widening in dispersion between the fortunes of those companies operating at the technological frontier and those operating inside this frontier
 Stifled competition in certain sectors and for certain products may have prevented the trickle-down of innovation
 Each generation has, since the Industrial Revolution, been around 25% better off than their parents
3% better off than their parents – a scarcely noticeable improvement
 In each case, there was a significant lag between the arrival of new technologies and their impact on productivity
35 Subsequent industrial revolutions have also seen a lag between the emergence of new technologies and their impact on productivity
 This may have reflected increased flows of labour, capital, ideas and information between firms, regions, sectors and countries
 Growth theory would predict that, over time, technological diffusion should lead to catch-up between frontier and non-frontier countries
 Another way of illustrating the same point is by looking at differences in productivity between frontier and periphery countries over time (Chart 11)
 40 Based on the following equation: 𝑃𝑖𝑡 − 𝑃𝑓𝑡 = 𝑎𝑖 + 𝑏𝑖 ∗ 𝐺𝐴𝑃𝑖  where 𝑃𝑖𝑡 is growth in TFP for country i in year t, Pft is the growth in TFP for the frontier country (US) in year t, GAPi  is the gap between the level of TFP in country i and the US as a percentage, ai is a constant capturing the average pace of convergence and bi captures how much of the speed of convergence depends on the TFP gap
 One sectoral story that could account for this generalised slowing is a reduced rate of factor reallocation between sectors
 In particular, there is a striking and widening divergence between frontier firms (say, the 99th percentile of firms) and the long tail of non-frontier companies
 If we define frontier firms as the top 5% of firms by productivity performance, in line with the OECD, there is clear and widening blue water between frontier and laggard companies (Chart 18)
 Looked at quantitatively, there is a statistically significant link between the quality of firms’ management processes and practices and their productivity
 We can quantify these benefits by looking in more detail at the relationship between firms’ productivity and their export share (Chart 23)
 As Chart 25 shows, there is a U-shaped relationship between firms’ productivity and debt, with both high-productivity (“gazelles”) and low-productivity (“zombie”) companies having high debt ratios
56  While there is an established literature on the aggregate relationship between productivity and wages, the relationship between firms’ productivity and average pay levels is less certain
  55 For example, Furman and Orszag (2016) 56 There is time series evidence to suggest a strong historical relationship between aggregate productivity and real wages
 But what about pay within firms?57  We can examine this by tracking differences between the average pay in each company and the pay of their highest paid director
 Chart 28 plots the median across firms of these series over time, while Chart 29 compares the variance of each series as well as the gap between average pay and the highest paid director
 The median gap between average pay and director pay has followed a similar pattern
61  57 For example, Song et al (2015) find that virtually all the rise in earnings dispersion between workers is accounted for by increasing dispersion across the average wages paid by different firms

 Over the course of the better part of a decade, a deep and wide-ranging international regulatory reform effort has been underway, as great as any since the Great Depression
 One of the new elements of the Basel III package was to supplement risk-weighted capital standards with a risk-unweighted leverage ratio
 A second new element of the Basel III package was to augment solvency with liquidity-based standards
 Another element is to ensure banks have sufficient loss-absorbing liabilities which can be “bailed-in” in the event of failure, to prevent losses being shouldered by tax-payers
 These capital add-ons apply to the 30 designated global systemically-important banks (G-SIBs) and the roughly 160 domestic systemicallyimportant banks (D-SIBs), to be phased-in between 2016 and 2019
 CDS spreads today sit roughly midway between their pre-crisis and mid-crisis averages
 Between the end of the  10  Chart 13 is not directly comparable with Chart 5 because it is based on a different definition of leverage and sample of banks
 It needs also to distinguish between any private costs to banks from tighter regulation and the social benefits this confers, with the latter the key public policy yardstick
 But the results presented were consistent with societal benefits peaking at a Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio of between 16-19%
 So what have we learned over the past decade about the likely magnitude of these parameters? The Benefits of Higher Capital Requirements The assumptions underpinning the marginal benefits of higher capital in the LEI study were as follows: banking crises occur, on average, once every 20-25 years; the median estimate of the cumulative discounted costs of a crisis is around 60% of annual pre-crisis GDP; each percentage point increase in the capital ratio reduces the probability of a banking crisis by a smaller amount, ranging from 1
 That is, ∂γ ∂k is indistinguishable from zero
 Micro-econometric studies on the link between bank failure and bank capital have found a more tangible relationship, however
 Jordà et al (2017) find that, while bank capital does not prevent a crisis from occurring, it matters for the pain suffered in its aftermath
 Banks that entered the crisis with higher capital have, on average, been better able to continue their lending
 For example, Greenwood et al (2017) argue that it may be distortionary and unnecessary to have multiple, independent constraints on banks’ behaviour
 RWCR & LR: Require small fraction of liabilities to be non-runnable equity but a small amount relative to illiquid assets
 If true risk of an asset can be estimated accurately – it is a “known known” - then the RWCR is typically better suited than the LR to guarding against solvency risk (Gordy (2003))
 Indeed, attempts to do so may result in “over-fitting”, increasing the potential fragility of these model estimates out-of-sample
 In uncertain settings, simpler weighting schemes have been found, in a variety of different environments, to offer a better defence against “unknown unknowns” (Gigerenzer (2014))
 For example, a 1/N or unweighted asset allocation heuristic (Benartzi and Thaler (2001)), which allocates an equal amount of wealth to each of the assets in one’s portfolio, has been found to outperform more complex strategies such as Markowitz’s (1952) mean-variance optimisation in out-of-sample tests, unless the sample size is very large
 While complex approaches can appear to perform better  19  For example, DeMiguel et al (2007) find that, for a sample threshold of N = 25, complex rules outperform simple ones only for sample sizes of in excess of 3000 months (250 years) of data
 In such circumstances, banks will be more robust if they have a buffer of high-quality liquid assets allowing them to meet outflows, survive the first stages of a bank run and, if necessary, giving the authorities time to prepare for resolution
20  These banks can be divided into those that ‘survived’ and those that ‘failed’ between 2007 and the end of 2009
 Now suppose that we have flexibility over the cut-off threshold necessary to achieve a particular hit rate, x
uk/speeches 25 25 At a target hit rate of 70%, a portfolio of regulatory measures does little better than the leverage ratio on its own in signalling bank stress
 These regimes have been found to be an effective way of balancing the pre-commitment necessary to avoid policy time-consistency problems with the flexibility necessary to respond to unforeseen circumstances (Arestis and Mihailov (2009), Borio (2010))
 Equally, as in the monetary policy sphere, there is a question about whether this new regulatory regime strikes the right balance between regulatory rules and the degree of discretion with which they are operated
 The time-inconsistency problem that pervades the debate over the balance between rules and discretion in monetary policy (Kydland and Prescott (1977), Barro and Gordon (1983)) is arguably even more acute for prudential policy
 For example, average risk weights on assets held in the trading book have increased by 45% across a sample of major UK banks between 2006 and 2013
 This was an intended, and probably desirable, behavioural response to a necessary recalibration of regulatory standards
 Canadian banks’ incentives sat somewhere in between
 When it comes to calibration, this means leverage and capital ratios need to be jointly determined to prevent incentives skewing in one or other direction
 Macroprudential Policy One of the greatest intellectual errors made in the run-up to the crisis was a classic “fallacy of composition”: it was assumed that the resilience of individual financial institutions was both a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure the resilience of the financial system as a whole
uk/speeches 31 31 subsequent theoretical and empirical work, has shown that the resilience of individual firms is neither necessary nor sufficient for the mitigation of systemic risk (Masera (2014), Crockett (1996))
 Or they might emerge from financial exposures, on- or off-balance sheet, between intermediaries operating in the global financial web (Haldane and May (2011), Arinaminpathy, Kapadia and May (2012))
 That paper cast the debate on the potential objectives of such a regime as a choice between ‘protecting banks from the cycle’ and ‘protecting the economy from the banks’
 Macroprudential policy could focus narrowly on building resilience in the financial system in a dynamic way, so that it was better able to absorb large adverse shocks
 Instruments of Macroprudential Policy The Bank of England’s second public foray into the macroprudential policy debate was a 2011 discussion paper on elements of the macroprudential toolkit (Bank of England (2011))
 Developing Ajello et al’s (2016) approach, the authors study an economy in which policymakers face a trade-off between stabilising inflation and output today versus keeping a lid on financial stability risks which threaten a crisis tomorrow
 For example, De Paoli and Paustian (2017) study a non-cooperative game between monetary and macroprudential authorities and find coordination problems to be significant following cost-push shocks in cases where objectives do not overlap
 By most accounts and on most evidence, that has resulted in a financial system which is more resilient than in the past, better equipped to head-off market frictions and failures of various kinds, better attuned to various adverse incentive effects, and better able to safeguard risks which imperil the financial system as a whole
 The key question, then, is whether these instruments prove to be as loss-absorbing in future situations of stress where bail-in becomes necessary
 That calls for models able to capture quantitatively monetary, financial and regulatory channels of transmission and the feedback mechanisms between them
 Progress has been made, in particular since the crisis, in developing macro-models with an explicit financial sector which can capture rich, two-way feedbacks between the economy and financial system (for example, Brunnermeier et al (2012), Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014))
 The direction of travel necessary to enrich these tests, and to make them truly macroprudential, is to incorporate feedback effects that can amplify the actions of individual institutions at the system-wide level (Demekas (2015), Brazier (2015), Tarullo (2016)) – feedbacks, for instance, that result from fire-selling assets, hoarding liquidity and counterparty risk
 As the financial system changes shape, it seems plausible to think that further change could be necessary
 If household debt externalities are within scope, is it better to deal with this risk by restricting mortgage lending directly via loan to income or loan to value limits, or by adding a macroprudential overlay to risk weights on mortgages (Turner (2017))? This lack of a settled approach has some benefits, in making for a diverse range of cross-country experiences
 Others have pointed to a possible U-shaped relationship between measures of financial depth and productivity and growth (Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012), Heil (2017))

 The haircuts in question are the amount of  collateral a borrower places with the lender over and above the face value of borrowing
 In the US, the repo  market financed roughly half of the growth in investment banks’ balance sheets between 2002 and 2007
 In the UK, fully two-thirds of the  trebling in balance sheets between 2002 and 2007 can be explained by expanding claims on other parts of  the financial system
 The greater the  concentration within the financial system, the greater the potential for systemic collapse as larger banks  spread a disproportionate amount of financial pain around a densely networked financial system
  To prevent this, policy makers could seek to control haircuts directly
 Today, it accounts for between two-thirds and three-quarters
 Others involve statistical arbitrage, using trading algorithms to  detect and exploit pricing anomalies between stocks or markets
uk/publications/speeches  5  5 One variant of these arbitrage strategies exploits pricing differences between common securities quoted on  competing trading platforms
 For HFT, that is the difference between the tortoise and the hare

 In general, the relationship between volatility and  correlation is positive
 Higher volatility increases the degree of co-movement between stocks

 In a 1967 paper, he  argued that stock prices could best be understood by distinguishing between two measuring rods: clock time  and volume time
17 While empirical studies typically used the first measuring rod (days, hours, seconds,  milli-seconds), stock prices were better understood by using the second
 As a result,  discrepancies emerged between the prices of common stocks trading on different exchanges (Chart 13)
  One source of contagion is between stock prices and derivatives written on these stocks
 HFT activity  means that arbitrage opportunities between these markets are likely to be quickly removed
26  A second channel of contagion is between different exchanges and trading platforms
  These involve a complex fusion between technology and human behaviour
 They close the  gap between man and machine, if only temporarily
 So in determining whether  there is a role for minimum resting periods, this trade-off between market efficiency and stability is key
 There is a sharp disconnect between popular perception of rising myopia,  driven by technology and neurology, and empirical evidence
    This new wave swamped empirical finance for the better part of a decade
15 Using an augmented version of this basic asset pricing framework, Miles (1993) tested formally for excessive  discounting of future cash-flows using company-level equity price data from the UK between 1980 and 1988,  finding evidence of short-termism over this period
 Under the CAPM, for example, the company specific risk premium is equal to the company specific beta multiplied by the  market risk premium ߨ௝௧ ൌ ߚ௝௧ ൫ܴ௠௧ െ ܴ௙௧൯
 Taking these in turn:  (a) Company-Specific Risk Premium  Following Miles (1993), the company risk premium is modelled based on firm-specific characteristics, in  particular the company beta and the level of gearing:  (10) ߨ௝௧ ൌ ߙଵߚ௝௧ ൅ ߙଶܼ௝௧ where ܼ ൌ ஽ ா 
 21 Betas are estimated using daily return data for firms listed on the S&P 500 and FTSE,  together with daily data for the indices themselves
22 Mean estimated betas are shown in Table 4
 As Charts 1 and 2 illustrate, however, the distribution of betas  is fairly wide, with over a third of US firms and almost a fifth of UK firms having a beta in excess of unity

  (c) Generating estimates of short-termism  Given estimates of company beta and gearing, risk-free rates and the instrumented variables, equation (9)  can be estimated to generate estimates of the short-termism parameter, x
 Empirical evidence  points to excess discounting of between 5% and 10% per year
 Ten-year ahead cash-flows under rational discounting are valued  similarly to between six-year (lower bound) and four-year (upper bound) ahead cash-flows under myopic  discounting
 Changes in the compensation  instrument can also help – for example, remunerating in equity is better than in cash and  remunerating in junior or convertible debt might be better than either
 Any imbalance between the rate at which international capital is  distributed and absorbed may spillover to global capital markets
 In the race between  capital market deepening in emerging markets and capital diversification in advanced economies, the latter  may gain the upper hand (or foot)
1  This enables us to track the growth in,  and financial linkages between, countries over time
 The node size for each country is measured as the absolute sum of its external  assets and liabilities, while the width of the links between nodes measures bilateral gross external assets
 So despite rising significantly in  absolute terms, financial globalisation has not obviously closed the gap between core and periphery
  But unlike for total external assets, the gap between core and periphery has been closing
 The relative  contribution of intra-advanced country external portfolio asset stocks fell from around 99% to 84% between  1980 and 2005
  To illustrate, Table 1 constructs some equity home bias estimates for the G20 countries between 1995 and  2007
 Home bias is measured here as an index lying between zero and one
   While seemingly modest in index terms, the implied portfolio reallocations amount to very sizable  portfolio equity flows
17 in measured US home bias between 1995 and 2007 corresponds to  an annual average portfolio reallocation to the rest of the world of around $370 billion (or 1
 Between 1995 and  2010, the emerging G20 countries more than quadrupled their share of the world equity market  portfolio, from 4% to 21% (Chart 6)
 Recently, these  measures have included:   In Hong Kong, the authorities imposed a cap on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and a maximum loan  amount on certain properties, alongside an increase in stamp duty on sales in October 2009
 This is  consistent with the economic growth literature emphasising the positive, two-way relationship between  financial deepening and economic growth (Levine (2005))
 The advanced economies’  share of G20 GDP halves between 2010 and 2050, from 70% to 36%, while the emerging G20 economies’  share rises from 30% to 64%
 Perhaps the most cogent explanations are grounded either in legal  restrictions (including capital controls and lack of property rights) and information asymmetries between  home and host countries (Gehrig (1993))
33 between 2010 and 2050
   (b) The Evolution of Financial Depth  Theory would predict a positive, two-way relationship between financial depth and economic development
 Chart 9 plots the cross-sectional relationship  between the log of GDP per capita and financial depth (measured as the ratio of equity market capitalisation  to GDP)
 But, unconstrained, such a simulation would imply a potentially unbounded relationship between  market capitalisation and a country’s GDP
 Between 1929  and 1990, the financial depth ratio in the US was roughly flat, at around 50%
   In money terms, the stock market capitalisation of the G20 emerging markets rises to around $300  trillion in 2050, while the G20 advanced economies amount to $170 trillion
 The global market  portfolio pie increases fourteen-fold between 2010 and 2050
 They include:   Should capital restrictions be used by emerging markets as a last resort once conventional  macroeconomic policies have been exhausted? Or should they instead play a supporting role in all  seasons, to avert excessive capital surges and accompanying fluctuations in financial activity? And  what guidelines, if any, should apply to the policies of advanced countries as the source of such  capital surges?   Are capital flow restrictions better conceived as a temporary or permanent measure? On the one  hand, temporary measures might better reflect the need to respond with exceptional measures only  in exceptional circumstances
   What are the respective roles of capital restrictions and financial market deepening as responses to  the BFSP problem? One policy option for emerging economies is to strengthen and deepen their  domestic capital market infrastructure, so that it is better able to absorb and intermediate incoming  foreign capital
 In countering systemic shocks, three supporting pillars have  understandably been felt to be better than one
 Though the  details are complex, the essence of these reforms is easily described: “more of the same – and better”

 Even  under this assumption the confidence intervals are significant, with the “true” capital ratio lying anywhere  between 15% above or below the reported ratio
 For a bank, that is the difference between life and death
 Reported regulatory capital ratios should better reflect risk and thus should  in principle offer timely advance warnings of impending bank stress
 First, the reported capital ratios of the two sets of  banks are largely indistinguishable
 Second, history suggests that, at least in the latest crisis, they would have given far timelier  signals of impending stress, and so a better guide to prompt corrective action, ahead of the crisis cliff-edge  being reached
  To illustrate that, Charts 6–8 look at the three market-based measures of solvency for the 33-bank panel,  again broken down between “crisis” and “no crisis” banks
 There is now clear blue water between the  solvency ratios of the crisis and non-crisis banks, with the second materially weaker
  Better resolution tools, which would be needed if CoCos are not enough, can lessen the dilemma and are an  essential part of the reform programme
 As such, they are a necessary ingredient for restoring market discipline
15 The trade-off between these two sets of benefits defines an optimal capital ratio for a firm to  maximise its expected value (Chart 9)
19 A rule to prevent the covering  of short positions with the proceeds of a CoCo conversion could provide a further disincentive to destabilising  short-selling of banks’ equity  
 But provided the price at which CoCos convert to equity is close to the  market price, conversion does not transfer value between existing equity-holders and CoCo investors
 That is roughly £70 billion, or around the  amount of external capital UK banks raised during the crisis
  Second, CoCo payouts potentially better align risk-taking incentives among staff and shareholders than cash  or even equity payouts
 This better aligns risk for shareholders and  staff with the risks for society at large
 A regulatory Gosplan will  work no better for bankers than it did for tractors
 These provide one element of a macroprudential policy framework
 Other elements remain to be put in place
  For example, a well-established body of literature has looked at the effects of asymmetric  information between borrowers and lenders in placing limits on credit (Bernanke, Gertler and  Gilchrist (1996), Holstrom and Tirole (1997))
 If the asset  is good, banks make a profit (normalised to be a negligible amount)
 A concern for reputation  incentivises banks to seek risky ventures (to keep dancing), the more so the better is the market’s  prior on the macro state (the louder the music)
 It is better  for your reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally
 The better is the macro state,  the greater banks’ incentive to pursue risky projects to preserve reputation, as the market attributes  low earnings to low ability
 In Rajan’s model this strategic  complementarity between banks generates multiple equilibria: in sufficiently good states, banks  coordinate on risky policies (“credit booms”), while in bad states they coordinate on tight policies  (“credit crunches”)
 In between, either equilibrium is possible
 Assume that banks observe fundamentals with some small amount of noise, with bank ݅ receiving signal  ,0 ൐ ߪ ,௜ߝߪ ൅ ߠ ൌ௜ ݔ where the noise terms ߝ ௜are distributed in the population with continuous density ݃ሺ
  Now suppose that financial liberalisation generates heightened competition between banks,  increasing the market premium on reputation
 Consistent  with the estimated density, shorter-term, business cycle fluctuations, say between 2-8 years, were  typically not found to account for much of the overall cyclical variation in credit
19 Over the sample period, these countries were in a state of banking  and/or currency crisis anywhere between 10% and 25% of the time
  First, measures of return dispersion are consistently lower for banks than for non-banks: simple  t-tests reject the null of equal mean dispersion between the two types of institution at the 1% level
22 At first sight this might seem to run counter  to the conventional wisdom that the correlation between asset prices tends to increase dramatically  during times of stress, while remaining muted in boom times
 There may be a link  between this and our concern with counter-cyclical dispersion
 23  To test this formally, we construct pair-wise correlations between countries’ credit cycles for two  post-war sub-samples, 1945-79 and 1980-2008
 The same technique can be applied to correlations between  countries’ medium term fluctuations in GDP (Chart 18)
  We observe an analogous pattern for credit cycles, with the correlation between countries’ credit  cycles higher on average after 1980
 26 Jennrich’s test for the equality of two correlation matrices derives a chi-squared distributed test statistic from  transformations of the correlation matrices, including a term correcting for the bounded support ([-1,1]) of the  difference between two correlations

 Between 2000 and 2007, UK nominal GDP growth  exhibited no signs of exuberance, with GDP growth at trend and inflation at target
 In this example, the increase in this threshold is sufficient to prevent risky  policies arising at any point over the horizon
  Without absolute clarity about the objectives of any macro-prudential policy framework and the  policy rule necessary to deliver these objectives, expectations will not adjust and policy will be  impotent
 For example, judgements on local credit conditions determine the amounts of capital to  be held by international banks on their exposures in those countries
 Simplicity to prevent confusion  about the objectives and transmission channels for macro-prudential policy, given the importance of  signalling
 Those medium-term forces suggest that  imbalances may get worse before they get better
 In others words,  capital flows are a necessary ingredient of trade and capital liberalisation
 But capital flows may also demonstrate an imbalance between demand and output in an  economy, which must eventually correct if debt and wealth stocks are not to become unsustainable
 Current account imbalances are no more than the arithmetic difference  between gross capital inflows and outflows
 As these gross flows increase as a result of financial  liberalisation, it is natural to expect the difference between them to become more volatile (Obstfeld (2010))
 First, the correlation between saving and investment rates appears to have weakened significantly over the  past two decades, for both surplus and deficit countries
  Historically, there has been a high correlation between national saving and investment rates – the FeldsteinHorioka (1980) puzzle
  Between 1930 and 1980, the Feldstein-Horioka coefficient was close to one – a puzzlingly high comovement between saving and investment

   4  Using firm-level data, Bayoumi, Tong and Wei (2010) argue that Chinese listed firms’ corporate savings rates are neither especially  high compared to listed firms in other countries and the gross savings rate for a typical listed Chinese firm has declined, albeit  insignificantly, between 2002-2007
 Among advanced countries, there is a  significant negative relationship between within-country measures of inequality and the current account  position (Chart 15)
 There is a well-defined empirical  relationship between a country’s GDP per head and its gross external balance sheet position (Chart 16)
  Cross-country correlations suggest a relationship between this prime-saving cohort and saving behaviour

 And measures of foregone output, now  and in the future, put the net present value cost of the crisis at anywhere between one and five  times annual world GDP (Haldane (2010))
 Measured real value added of the  financial intermediation sector more than trebled between 1980 and 2008, while whole  economy output doubled over the same period
 Between 1948 and 1978, intermediation accounted on average for around  1
 Total returns to holders of major banks’ equity in the  UK, US and euro area rose a cumulative 150% between 2002 and 2007 (Chart 5)
  To illustrate this rather starkly, consider a hedged bet placed back in 1900, which involved  going long by £100 in financial sector equities and short in non-financial equities by the same  amount
 From 1900 up  until the end of the 1970s, this bet yielded pretty much nothing, with financial and nonfinancial returns rising and falling roughly in lockstep
 The calculation is based on the difference  between the effective rates of interest (payable and receivable) and a ‘reference’ rate of  interest, multiplied by the stock of outstanding balances
  The productive activity provided by an effectively functioning banking system might be  better thought of as measuring and pricing credit and liquidity risk
  Stripping out the compensation for bearing risk to better reflect the service component of the  financial sector could be achieved in different ways
  (ii) Measuring Risk  Adjusting FISIM for risk would better capture the contribution of the financial sector to the  economy
 This amounts  to relating growth in GDP to growth in labour input and in various capital services (from  buildings, vehicles, computers and other resources)
  Assuming constant returns to scale, perfect competition (so that factors of production are paid  their marginal products) and Hicks-neutral technical change (so that shifts in the production  function do not affect marginal rates of substitution between inputs), output growth can be  expressed as a weighted sum of the growth rates of inputs and an additional term that  captures shifts over time in the production technology
 The proportion of labour employed by finance rises  by around 50% between 1977 and 1990, while the proportion of capital almost trebles from  4% to 12% over the same period
2% per year between 1995 and  2007 (Chart 10)
  Measured TFP growth in the financial sector exceeded that of the whole economy across  many developed countries between 1995-2007, a trend that accelerated in the ‘bubble’ years  of 2003-2007 (Chart 11)
 Broadly speaking,  the rise in GVA is equally split between the returns to labour (employee compensation) and  to capital (gross operating surplus)
 This resulted  in a divergence between reported and risk-adjusted returns
 According to data compiled by the  Banker, the balance sheets of the world’s largest 1000 banks increased by around 150%  between 2001 and 2009 (Chart 21)
  Measures of gearing rose sharply between 2000 and 2008 among the major global banks,  other than US commercial banks which were subject to a leverage ratio constraint (Chart 24)
  Between 1997 and 2008, as UK banks increased leverage, they managed to maintain broadly  constant capital ratios by, on average, seeking out assets with lower risk weights (Chart 27)
  Table 4 shows two of the elements of this breakdown for the major global banks – leverage  and unit risk
  A better arbiter of market power may be measures of market contestability, in particular the  potential for barriers to entry to and exit from the market
 So provided this model adequately captures  risk, these estimates ought to risk-adjust returns across the different business lines, allocating  greater amounts of capital to riskier activities
 The OFT market study found a very low rate of  switching of personal current accounts between banks – fewer than 6% per year
 To complicate matters, banks’ annual  accounts data do not differentiate simply between these activities – for example, between  market-making and proprietary trading activities in fixed income, currency and commodities  (FICC) and equities
  The lack of a breakdown between client and proprietary sources of revenues is problematic  when making sense of investment banking activities, both in the run-up to and during the  crisis
 Better aggregate statistics and bank-specific performance  measures could help better to distinguish miracles and mirages
 It helps calibrate the  intervention necessary to tackle systemic risk, whether through regulation or restrictions
  As Table 1 shows, these losses are multiples of the static costs, lying anywhere between one and  five times annual GDP
 Put in money terms, that is an output loss equivalent to between $60  trillion and $200 trillion for the world economy and between £1
 “Economical” might be a better description
  Table 2 looks at this average ratings difference for a sample of banks and building societies in the  UK, and among a sample of global banks, between 2007 and 2009
  First, standalone ratings are materially below support ratings, by between 1
7  The resulting money amount is an estimate of the reduction in banks’  funding costs which arises from the perceived government subsidy
  Table 4 shows the estimated value of that subsidy for the same sample of UK and global banks,  again between 2007 and 2009
13 Under this framework, the optimal amount of pollution  control is found by equating the marginal social benefits of pollution-control and the marginal  private costs of this control
 With no uncertainty about either costs or benefits, a policymaker  would be indifferent between taxation and restrictions when striking this cost/benefit balance
 Weitzman’s  framework tells us how to choose between pollution-control instruments in this setting
 If the private costs of the  wrong choice are high, relative to the social benefits foregone, fixing these costs through taxation  is likely to deliver the better welfare outcome
 It prevented commercial banks from conducting most types of  securities business, including principal trading, underwriting and securities lending
 These losses transmitted to the  real economy through a collapse in lending, whose stock halved between 1929 and 1933
 Measures of concentration in the US banking system remained  broadly flat between the 1930s and the late 1980s (Chart 2)
  The share of the top three largest US banks in total assets rose fourfold, from 10% to 40%  between 1990 and 2007 (Chart 2)
 This can be seen in the relationship  between diversification on the one hand and diversity on the other
 Homogeneity breeds fragility
  The precise balance between diversification and diversity depends on banks’ balance sheet  configuration
19  There is no strong relationship between either size or diversity and income volatility
 But it suggests that, in the arm wrestle between  diversification and diversity, the latter appears to have held the upper hand
 Bigger and broader  banking does not obviously appear to have been better, at least in a risk sense
 Putting uncertainties to  one side, assume the policymaker could calibrate perfectly tail risk in the system today and the  capital necessary to insure against it
  Do those arguments resonate within advanced country banking systems today? Two  comprehensive studies in the mid-1990s found that economies of scale in banking are exhausted  at relatively modest levels of assets, perhaps between $5-10 billion
43  If successful, that effort would shift the balance of the Weitzman cost/benefit calculus in the  direction of bigger banks; it could help achieve the modularity, robustness and better aligned  incentives which restrictions otherwise deliver
 For that reason, it is possible that no amount of  capital or liquidity may ever be quite enough
 The first phase of the Great Depression, between 1929 and 1933, saw  the failure of a large number of US banks
 Between 1933 and 1937, the US economy  recovered somewhat
 In other words, these  are risky bets
 The crisis has also revealed, however, examples of bets which were,  on the face of it, essentially risk-less deviations from EMH or “apparent arbitrage”
 Chart 4 looks at the difference  between two, again on the face of it, identical money market bets – forward rate  agreement spreads and forward rates implied by the LIBOR spreads, both of the same  maturity
  So why were the bets not placed and the arbitrage opportunities exploited? First,  money is needed to place even a riskless bet
 Second, placing a bet also  requires a trustworthy bookmaker
 But the ability to engage in such gambling for redemption  depends importantly on the degree of information asymmetry between the    14 James (1992)
 The lower the transparency of the accounts, the  greater the incentives and ability of management to bet the ranch
  Between 2001 and 2006, UK banks’ cumulative profits would have been around £100  billion higher than recorded profits, as the expected future returns to risky projects  were brought forward
22 Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between, with some market and institutions  affected and others immune
  Underlying both of these debates is a perceived tension between the needs of different  stakeholders, in particular investors and regulators
  In general terms, however, the point is clear: efficient markets are not necessary but  may be sufficient to justify the use of fair value principles
  • Better accounting for expected losses  What is clear from these examples is that there is a potential trade-off in the use of  amortised cost versus fair value measures when market prices deviate from EMH
 Recognising the  problems with either, is there a way of doing better than both?  19 Perhaps the simplest way of doing so would be to use both valuation metrics
 Or in the words of  Macbeth’s three witches, “double, double, toil and trouble”
 Or, put differently,  precisely because market prices embody a liquidity premium, they could give a better  view of the true asset position of a firm facing liquidity constraints
  Rethinking valuation practices across firms, asset classes and countries, better to  capture expected losses, is one important such filter
  Between July 2007 and March 2009, the equity prices of global banks fell by 75%
 Global banks' net  income in 2009 is expected to be around $60 billion, compared to a loss of roughly  that amount in 2008
  The sectoral contributions to this rise in debt are roughly equally split between  households, companies, the financial sector and governments
5  Despite recent capital raising, banks’ leverage remains high  absolutely and relative to the past, at between 20 and 50 times equity (Chart 9)
 Among UK banks, it is in excess of £1 trillion between now and 2014
  Among global banks, net income fell by over 20% between 2006 and 2007
 If UK banks had reduced  dividend payouts ratios by a third between 2000 to 2007, £20 billion of extra capital  would have been generated
16 Preventing Tomorrow’s Debt Hangover  Once today’s debt hangover is solved, how is tomorrow’s to be prevented? As debt  crises have been with us for a millennium, it is fanciful to think they could be  eliminated
 But could the party be moderated in frequency and scale? In seeking new  ways to tackle this old problem, two possible avenues would be the re-orientation of  regulatory policy on the one hand and better designed debt contracts on the other
17  Although the name is new, it is in the time-honoured policy tradition of “removing the  punchbowl” from the party as it is getting started – a fitting analogy if the aim is to  prevent a debt hangover
  A better-designed debt contract would automatically adjust repayment terms when the  borrower found the going getting tough
 Mortgages would  operate like a contractually pre-committed debt-equity swap between households and    18 Bernanke, B and Gertler, M (1989), “Agency costs, net worth and business fluctuations”, American  Economic Review, 14-31
 But this does not prevent them issuing debt with  equity-like characteristics
  And having been nurtured early, the relationship between bank and customer often  lasted a lifetime
 Between different parties  at different times, that loss of trust has been the root cause of the devastating impact  felt globally since the credit crunch began
  The proximate cause of the crisis was a breakdown of trust between banks and  households, specifically sub-prime mortgage-holders in the United States
 The  equity prices of banks tumbled, falling 86% on average for the major UK banks  between February 2007 and March this year (Chart 4)
  Underlying these price falls was a generalised loss of trust between banks and  investors in banks, such as sovereign wealth funds and mutual funds
  And as corporate distress rose, in particular after the failure of Lehman Brothers,  distrust between companies mounted
 The stream of trade credit extended between  firms dried to a trickle at the end 2008 and in the first part of 2009
  This progressive hardening of the credit arteries also had dramatic effects between  countries
  7 between 2003 and 2007
 So with confidence turning can  we anticipate an imminent return of credit to the economy?  Rising confidence among firms and consumers is a necessary condition for recovery
 This is consistent with trust between financial institutions and their  customers being slower to recover than confidence more generally
  So the economics of banking do not suggest that bigger need be better
 There is not a scrap of  evidence of economies of scale or scope in banking – of bigger or broader being  11 better - beyond a low size threshold
 For  the Ford Motor Company, bigger was better
 For  example, the provision of monetary services – basic banking – has a strong public  good element
 Lending to households and companies can  also be thought to contain a public good element
  During the upswing, banks enjoyed windfall gains from bets at the race-track
 But when those bets turned sour, these same activities put at  risk banks’ day job – the provision of loan and deposit services to the real economy
 While it might be sensible  for an individual firm to diversify its business lines to reduce its risk, if this same  strategy is followed by all banks the end-result may be greater fragility across the  whole system
 This would reduce the risks of spill-over between privately and socially  beneficial banking activities
 And it would help prevent banks making individually  rational but collectively calamitous strategic choices
  • Governance - stakeholders versus shareholders In deciding appropriate corporate governance arrangements, economists have tended  to focus on the relationship between shareholders (as principal) and managers (as  agent)
 In addressing one incentive problem,  however, this approach may risk worsening two others – between shareholders and  depositors on the one hand and between shareholders and the public sector on the  other
 In this way, mutuality reduces the scope  for misaligned incentives between shareholders and depositors which might otherwise  arise in a joint stock bank
 For example, it does not address the  potential incentive problem between stakeholders and the public sector
 Indeed, mutuality may do a better job  of aligning stakeholder incentives than some alternative forms of corporate  governance
 In rebuilding the financial  system, to create one which is both stable and better able to meet the needs of the real  economy, these principles need to be rediscovered

  Adaptive because behaviour in these networks was driven by interactions between  optimising, but confused, agents
 Three areas in particular are discussed:  • Data and Communications: to allow a better understanding of network dynamics  following a shock and thereby inform public communications
 This has led  to…concern that the fragility of the system has increased, in part because the degree  of operational, liquidity and credit interdependency has risen sharply”
 As these marketable instruments passed between participants, the  network chain lengthened
 Viewed across the system as a whole, however, it is clear now that these  strategies generated the opposite result: the greater the number of eggs, the greater  the fragility of the basket - and the greater the probability of bad eggs
 Nodes grew in size and interconnections between them multiplied
 Based on  their experience, complexity plus homogeneity did not spell stability; it spelt  fragility
  9 tropical rainforests highlighted their inherent fragility
 Between 1997 and 2007, buffeted by oil  prices shocks, wars and dotcom mania, the financial system stood tall; it appeared  self-regulating and self-repairing
  (a) Connectivity and Stability  Over the past 30 years, a great deal has been established about the links between  network connectivity and robustness
  Risk-spreading – fragility - prevails
 A lengthy period of seeming robustness (the Golden Decade from 1997  to 2007) was punctuated by an acute period of financial fragility (the period since)
 This  showed that the average path length (number of links) between any two individuals  was around six – hence “six degrees of separation”
 That could occur  between different institutions or between different nation states
  In Charts 1-3, the nodes are scaled in proportion to total external financial stocks,  while the thickness of the links between nodes is proportional to bilateral external  financial stocks relative to GDP
 And what is true between countries is also likely to have  been true between institutions within countries
 Between the largest nation states, there are fewer than 1
 From a stability perspective, it translates into a robust-yet-fragile  system, susceptible to a loss of confidence in the key financial hubs and with rapid    13 Specifically, nodes are scaled by (Total External Assets + Total External Liabilities) for each node,  and links between nodes i and j by (Total External Assetsij + Total External Liabilitiesij )/(GDPi +  GDPj)
 These rational responses by banks to fear of infection added to the  fragility of an already robust-yet-fragile financial network
 Bank A could  monitor Bank B’s creditworthiness, if necessary directly, and price the insurance  accordingly
  This added yet a further layer of fragility to the financial system
  Though it had aimed to dampen institutional risk, innovation in financial instruments  served to amplify further network fragility
 The oceans  provide a rich and lengthy test-bed of the links between diversity and robustness
18 For around 800 years, between the years 1000-1800AD, fish stocks and  species numbers were seemingly stable and robust
 The average pairwise correlation between these different  funds’ strategies was roughly zero at the turn of the century
  20 Part 2: Improving Network Stability  This is a gloomy prognosis: a financial system teetering between triumph and  disaster
 This brings together over 120 international  institutions and networks to share resources to better identify and manage outbreaks
  What more might be done to prevent a repeat? Part of the answer lies in improved  data, part in improved analysis of that data, and part in improved communication of  the results
 More fundamentally,  this approach provides little information on the links between nodes
 Some data exist on the degree of linkage between financial firms – for  example, from regulatory returns on large exposures
 For  example, the de Larosiere Report (2009) calls for a European and, ultimately, global  initiative to create an international register of claims between financial institutions
 This is important  both ex-ante as a means of better pricing and managing risk, and ex-post as a means  of containing that risk
 The preventative response has taken the  form of moralising about sexual abstinence and monogamy

 From a network  resilience perspective, it is important that in future the central counterparty question  becomes not “Why?” but “Why not”?  Second, financial innovation has created strings of gross claims between financial  entities which far exceed their capital bases
  Intra-system claims on this scale increase network fragility
 Financial engineers  created products in which elements of a loan portfolio were reassigned to a higherorder sub-assembly
 In other cases it was the result  of regulatory design: for the larger part of the past century, the Glass-Steagall Act in  the US prohibited inter-breeding between commercial and investment banking
 They failed Keynes’ test – that it is  better to be roughly right than precisely wrong
 Between October 1998 and June 2007, banks’ share  prices increased almost 60% and their balance sheets rose more than threefold
  Estimated losses within the financial sector since the start of the crisis lie anywhere  between a large number and an unthinkably large one
 Doing so better enables both financial institutions  and the authorities to pinpoint what needs to change and how
 The financial system is similarly a network,  with nodes defined by the financial institutions and links defined by the financial  interconnections between these institutions
7  To the  extent this is done at all, it requires firms to make assumptions about correlations  between asset prices
 For a financial firm leveraged 20+ times,  those risk revisions could be the difference between success and failure
 First, internally, through the relationship  between risk managers and the risk-takers within financial firms; and second,  externally, in the relationship between financial firms and the authorities
  Decision-making within firms is an arm-wrestle between risk and return, between risk  managers and risk-takers
  The second principal-agent problem, between firms and the authorities, is different in  kind but similar in consequence
 This is simply a variant of the old adage that if you owe the bank a small  amount it is your problem, a large amount it is theirs
 These days, if a bank owes a  small amount it is their problem, a large amount it is the authorities
 The key elements here are devising a  multi-factor risk scenario that is sufficiently extreme to constitute a tail event
  Arguably, designing such a scenario is better delegated to the authorities than  to individual firms, in part because they ought to be more immune to disaster  myopia
 This will better enable firms to assess the spillover and  contagion consequences of their own and others’ actions, so helping  internalise to some degree the network externality problems which have been  prevalent through this crisis
 I have outlined some elements of such an agenda,  to address some of the failures exposed by the crisis
 These measures involve a  greater degree of engagement both between risk managers and senior management  within firms, and between financial firms and the authorities
 These measures would not prevent a next time – nor should they – but they might help make risk management roughly right
