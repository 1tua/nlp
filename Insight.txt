 It was titled “Public Policy in an Era of Super-Systemic Risk”
[19] When it came to managing systemic risk, complexity science was rich in answers too
 The FPC was charged with safeguarding systemic risk in the UK using new macro-prudential tools
 Specifically, this could lead to a closer alignment of risk for those institutions, new and old, offering these services - narrow banking for payments (money backed by safe assets) and limited purpose banking for lending (risky assets backed by risky liabilities)
 Second, acting in the opposite direction, there are downside risks to this output projection as we move into the fourth quarter due to the new lockdown measures and any future measures
 The crisis scarred risk appetite
 Post-crisis risk aversion, and changes in the nature of work, may have increased insecurities and dimmed workers’ appetite for a vertiginous career climb – or indeed any climb
 Certainly, downside risks to the global and UK economy have increased through this year
 Today, the most likely shocks or downside risks to the economy are very different in their source and impact
 This so-called “psychological scarring” of risk appetite was also a dampener of credit and aggregate demand following the Great Depression
 Indeed, there are reasons to think there are significant downside risks to the inflation outlook, as the MPC’s fan charts illustrate clearly
 On the one hand, the hit to capital could be larger if firms’ risk appetite remains subdued or if the debts accumulated during the crisis act as a drag on investment
uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice 22 22 (e) Psychological Scarring A final potential difference from the past concerns the degree of psychological scarring of risk appetite among household and companies as a result of crisis
 Low risk appetite after the global financial crisis was a correction of the excessive risk-taking that took place in the run-up – an overshoot followed by an undershoot

 Deep, reflecting the severity of the hit to balance sheets, risk appetite and economic activity that the crisis has inflicted and continues to inflict
 These should help in pricing institution-specific risk by financial markets and ratings agencies
 But by making the financial system more resilient to future shocks, it may also reduce the tail risk of bad macroeconomic outcomes
uk/speeches 15 15 There are of course a variety of other reasons why banks’ willingness to make markets, and why market liquidity more generally, might have been affected by the crisis – for example, reduced risk appetite and increased counterparty risk
 Some individual parts of the regulatory rulebook - such as the use of internal ratings-based risk weights - also remain complex
 If risk can be measured and risk weights can be chosen appropriately, this allows for the greatest level of granularity
 RWCR: Provides loss absorbing capacity but may perform less well out-of-sample and vulnerable to model risk (IRB approach) or miscalibration of risk weights (standardised approach)
 Vulnerability to risk shifting arbitrage RWCR: High degree of granularity reduces the scope for risk-shifting LCR & NSFR: standardised assumptions mitigate some scope to shift risk but also allow some scope for distortion if weights are miscalibrated
 LR: Greatest scope for distortion through risk shifting because of lack of risk sensitivity
 Crystallisation of systemic liquidity risk leading to a fire sales, liquidity hoarding, and/or a contraction in lending NSFR: Reduces banks’ vulnerability to mediumterm liquidity risks and hence the probability of them being required to deleverage rapidly in periods of stress to shore up their liquidity position
 RWCRs oblige banks to assign granular risk weights to their assets
 Greenwood et al (2017) conclude “the social optimum can be implemented with a single requirement that each bank maintain a sufficient ratio of equity to risk-weighted assets, provided the risk weights are chosen appropriately”
 In a world of such Knightian uncertainty, it may be difficult to estimate risk weights on individual assets with any degree of precision
 But they then still rely on regulators’ risk models, which may be vulnerable to similar issues, especially if they are formulated in an excessively granular manner (Hale et al (2015))
 On the other hand, the horizon for assessing banks’ liquidity risk may matter
 Because these fault-lines were, for some banks, reasonably well-correlated – their risk management was poor across all dimensions – individual regulatory metrics performed fairly well in identifying these banks prior to them failing
76, indicative of the structural liquidity risk it was undertaking
 Excessive homogeneity of the financial system can create systemic risks (Haldane (2009a), Wagner (2010))
 For example, average risk weights on assets held in the trading book have increased by 45% across a sample of major UK banks between 2006 and 2013
 And Basel III came in part as a response to both risk models, and the Basel framework itself, being arbitraged
 For example, if the regulatory constraint takes the form of a leverage ratio there are incentives to alter the composition of assets towards those with higher risk weights – though the evidence on such “risk-shifting” is mixed (Sheldon (1996), Furlong (1988))
 Contrarily, if assets are risk-weighted and determined by banks’ internal models, there are incentives to lower modelled risk weights over time (Mariathasan and Merrouche (2014))
 In Europe, without a leverage ratio but with risk-based capital standards, there were incentives for banks to expand balance sheets and shade downwards risk weights
 Conversely, the leverage ratio can serve as an effective constraint on incentives to game or shade risk weights
 Incentives to game risk weights can be constrained by imposing floors and/or by using standardised approaches for certain categories of assets
uk/speeches 31 31 subsequent theoretical and empirical work, has shown that the resilience of individual firms is neither necessary nor sufficient for the mitigation of systemic risk (Masera (2014), Crockett (1996))
 There has been progress, too, in developing models of systemic risk which assign macroeconomic factors, and within-system feedbacks, a prominent role (Greenwood et al (2014), Cont and Schaanning (2017))
 The direction of travel necessary to enrich these tests, and to make them truly macroprudential, is to incorporate feedback effects that can amplify the actions of individual institutions at the system-wide level (Demekas (2015), Brazier (2015), Tarullo (2016)) – feedbacks, for instance, that result from fire-selling assets, hoarding liquidity and counterparty risk
 Non-bank sources of systemic risk proved to be potent during the crisis, in particular among shadow banks
 What was once credit and funding risk on the balance sheets of banking firms is metamorphosing into market and liquidity risk on the balance sheets of funds and investment vehicles of various types (Stein (2013))
 Systematic, market-wide stress simulations might be needed to capture new market and liquidity risks and their propagation across different financial institutions and markets (Brazier (2017b))
 Nonetheless, it also gives rise to potentially new sources of systemic risk and contagion, as risks change shape and location
 A world of greater market and liquidity risk may call for different sets of regulatory instrument than the bank-based solvency and liquidity metrics of Basel III
 If household debt externalities are within scope, is it better to deal with this risk by restricting mortgage lending directly via loan to income or loan to value limits, or by adding a macroprudential overlay to risk weights on mortgages (Turner (2017))? This lack of a settled approach has some benefits, in making for a diverse range of cross-country experiences

 The  quest for risk sensitivity in Pillar I rules caused regulatory complexity and opacity to blossom
 Risk management will be  more extensive and in future it will be more robust

  At one level, this is technical progress; it is the appliance of science to risk management

2   Various international macro-prudential policy committees are, or are about to be, put in place – in  the US the Financial Stability Oversight Committee, in the euro-area the European Systemic Risk  Board and in the UK the Financial Policy Committee
 As those risk illusions were  shattered, all of the pre-crisis gains in banks’ reported returns were lost
 4 At the beginning of each period, each bank originates a risky asset, the return on which    3  For other applications of the “global games” framework to banking, see inter alia, Rochet and Vives (2004) and  Goldstein and Pauzner (2005)
 If an  asset turns out to be bad, banks can hide negative earnings in the short run by engaging in risky  policies to boost returns – in effect, engaging in risk illusion
 But risky policies always involve longer  term expected losses of ܿ൐ܽ
  If instead of setting risky policies banks choose immediately to liquidate assets, they set a tight  policy, realising a loss of -1 for sure
 If returns are low, under a risky policy banks can increase short term  earnings with some positive probability, but must incur a long term loss; while under a tight policy,  banks can accept low short term earnings for sure now, avoiding losses in the future
 If a bank chooses a risky (superscript ݎ (policy, it obtains  ݑ௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ ൌ ሺ1െߛሻሾെሺ1െܽሻ െ ܿሿ ൅ ݌ߛ௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ, 6  where a proportion ݈ of all banks also set a risky policy
 The  marginal effect on reputation of banks adopting risky rather than tight policies is given by  ݌ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ ؠ ݌ ௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ െ ݌௧ ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ, We posit ݌ఏ ൐ 0: improvements in the macro state increase the incentive banks face to liberalise  their risk management policies
  We also posit ݌ ൐ ௟0: as a larger proportion of banks set risky credit policies, the larger the incentive  to pursue similarly risky policies
 But one bank’s announcement of positive earnings encourages others  to announce positive earnings by setting risky policies too
 In Rajan’s model this strategic  complementarity between banks generates multiple equilibria: in sufficiently good states, banks  coordinate on risky policies (“credit booms”), while in bad states they coordinate on tight policies  (“credit crunches”)
 6 ݌௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ is the probability assigned by the market of the bank being high ability, conditional on the bank setting a risky  policy (unobserved by the market), the asset being bad, the macro state being ߠ and proportion ݈ other banks also setting  risky policies
 7 ݌௧ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ is defined analogously to ݌௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ, but is conditioned on tight rather than risky policies
 This captures the marginal return to adopting a risky policy
 It allows us to define the regions of  fundamentals over which risky policies and tight policies dominate respectively
 A risky policy  dominates a tight policy, even when no other banks set risky policies (݈ൌ0), when ߠ൐ߠҧ where  ݌ሺߠҧ, 0ሻ ൌ ሺܿെܽሻ ൬ ߛ1െ 
൰ ߛ A tight policy dominates a risky policy, even when other banks set risky policies (݈ൌ1), when ߠ൏ߠ where  ݌ሺߠ ,1ሻ ൌ ሺܿ െ ܽሻ ൬1െߛ 
  Using (1) it follows that the threshold level of fundamentals above which banks set risky policies is  (a) increasing in the long-term cost of extending bad credit ܿ, and (b) decreasing in relative  reputational concerns ߛ ,or ݀כߠ כߠ݀ ,0/݀ܿ ൐  
 First, increasing the cost to banks of pursuing risky strategies  causes banks to coordinate on risky policies only at very high levels of fundamentals
 Or, put  differently, safety prevails over a larger range of fundamentals when risky policies are costly
  Prudential policies (discussed further in Section 5) are one means of raising the cost to banks of  pursuing such risky strategies
 But it also leads bank ݅ to expect fewer other banks to adopt risky policies
 As greater weight is placed on shortterm reputation, incentives are sharpened to signal high ability by pursuing risky policies, even  when their signalling effect is relatively small (ߠ is low)
 But with reputational  externalities, productivity shocks become amplified by the credit cycle: a high realisation of ߝ in  period ݐെ1 could push the macro state above the risky policy threshold, at which point the  dynamics of ݑ௧ begin also to shape the real economy
  Intuitively, this makes them more likely to choose the risky policy
  10  ݀ככߠ݀/ߛ ൏ 0, such that higher costs of risk taking and lower reputational concerns decrease the  probability of risky policies being adopted
 But it also drives up volatility due to risk illusion
 It becomes more likely,  then, that bankers will coordinate on the risk taking equilibrium
 As the macro state hits the threshold, banks adopt  risky policies to signal high ability
 The threshold for risky policies  falls
 First, strategic complementarities  incentivise banks to adopt risky strategies in a coordinated fashion during the boom
 Second, at a micro-economic level, the  coordination of risky strategies during the boom should compress the dispersion of bank earnings,  as low ability banks masquerade as high ability banks during good times
 In this sense, there is a direct  analogy with our model, in which strategic complementarities in risk taking can generate persistent credit cycles in  response to high-frequency fluctuations in fundamentals
 A second implication is that the dispersion in returns may be  smaller for financial than for non-financial companies to the extent that former are more susceptible  to risk illusion
  The crises generated by excessive risk taking in our model would generate heightened volatility in a time series sense
 Ours relies on excessive risk taking in a world of imperfect  information

  Chart 21 illustrates the impact of increasing the long term cost of short term risky strategies, ܿ, across the entire system in our simple model
 But if the regulator raises the cost of risky policies, the signalling threshold rises to the  green dashed line
  Chart 21: Model simulation high long term cost of short term risky strategies    Source: Bank calculations  Fifth, because credit cycles emerge from a failure to co-ordinate lending decisions, expectations are  crucial for the effectiveness of macro-prudential policies
  Risk illusion, rather than a productivity miracle, appears to have driven high returns to  finance
 A key issue is the extent to which  bearing risk should be measured as a productive service provided by the banking system
  (i) Adjusting FISIM for Risk  Under current FISIM guidelines, which use risk-free policy rates to measure the reference  rate, banks’ compensation for bearing risk constitutes part of their measured nominal output
 For example, assume there is an economy-wide  increase in the expected level of defaults on loans or in liquidity risk, as occurred in October  2008
 Banks take  on maturity mismatch or liquidity risk on behalf of households and companies
 But it  is not clear that bearing risk is, in itself, a productive activity
 Any household or corporate  investing in a risky debt security also bears credit and liquidity risk
 The act of investing  capital in a risky asset is a fundamental feature of capital markets and is not specific to the  activities of banks
  The productive activity provided by an effectively functioning banking system might be  better thought of as measuring and pricing credit and liquidity risk
 And they manage liquidity risk through their treasury operations, thereby acting as  delegated treasurer
  Stripping out the compensation for bearing risk to better reflect the service component of the  financial sector could be achieved in different ways
 Explaining Aggregate Returns in Banking – Excess Returns and Risk Illusion How do we explain these high, but temporary, excess returns to finance which appear to have  driven the growing contribution of the financial sector to aggregate economic activity? In  this section we discuss potential balance sheet strategies which may have contributed to these  rents
 In that sense,  the banking “productivity miracle” may have been, at least in part, a mirage – a simple, if  dramatic, case of risk illusion by banks, investors and regulators
  Between 1997 and 2008, as UK banks increased leverage, they managed to maintain broadly  constant capital ratios by, on average, seeking out assets with lower risk weights (Chart 27)
 As such hybrid instruments have shown themselves largely unable to absorb losses  during the crisis, this boost to ROE is also likely to have been an act of risk illusion
 Trading book assets tended to attract risk weights appropriate for dealing  with market but not credit risk
  (c) Writing deep out-of-the-money options  A third strategy, which boosted returns by silently assuming risk, arises from offering tail risk  insurance
 Banks can in a variety of ways assume tail risk on particular instruments – for  example, by investing in high-default loan portfolios, the senior tranches of structured  products or writing insurance through credit default swap (CDS) contracts
  Until, that is, tail risk manifests itself, at which point losses can be very large
 The productivity miracle was in fact a  risk illusion
 By acting in that  way, the risk-taking incentives of each business unit can be aligned with the business as a  whole, thereby complementing firms’ internal risk management
 Risk illusion is no accident; it is there by  design
 Systemic risk is a noxious by-product
  Public policy has long-recognised the costs of systemic risk
 This is recognition of the  social costs of systemic risk
 What does it suggest?  Counting the Systemic Cost  One important dimension of the debate concerns the social costs of systemic risk
 It helps calibrate the  intervention necessary to tackle systemic risk, whether through regulation or restrictions
 If a systemic tax is to be  levied, a more precise measure may be needed of banks’ distinctive contribution to systemic risk
 And add-ons to these capital and liquidity buffers for institutions posing the  greatest systemic risk are being discussed to address the second
9  In essence, this is a taxation  solution to the systemic risk pollution problem
  Basel II was underpinned by a complex menu of capital risk weights
  (c) Incentives  Tail risk within some systems is determined by God – in economist-speak, it is exogenous
  Natural disasters, like earthquakes and floods, are examples of such tail risk
  Tail risk within financial systems is not determined by God but by man; it is not exogenous but  endogenous
 So there are natural incentives within the financial system to generate tail risk  and to avoid regulatory control
25 The endogeneity of tail risk in banking poses a dilemma for regulation
 Putting uncertainties to  one side, assume the policymaker could calibrate perfectly tail risk in the system today and the  capital necessary to insure against it
 In an echo of the 1979 Madness song, banks would then  have incentives to position themselves “One Step Beyond” the regulatory buffer to harvest the  higher returns that come from assuming tail risk
 Tail risk would expand to exhaust available  resources
  This dynamic means it is hazardous to believe there is a magic number for regulatory ratios  sufficient to insure against tail risk in all states of the world
 Because tail risk is created not  endowed, calibrating a capital ratio for all seasons is likely to be, quite literally, pointless –  whatever today’s optimal regulatory point, risk incentives mean that tomorrow’s is sure to be  different
  In response, some economists have proposed corner solutions to the systemic risk problem – in  effect, radical structural redesign
 Tail risk is bigger in  banking because it is created, not endowed
  • “Timely Risk Management”  Perhaps the most recent of the arguments used to support fair values arises from its  role as a risk management device
 Among market participants, the use of fair values and fleet-offoot risk management techniques is widely felt to have contributed to the relative  success of some firms during the course of the crisis
 This approach  provides an essential early warning system that is critical for risk managers and regulators”, Lloyd  Blankfein, Financial Times, October 13 2009
 It is  precisely such risk management incentives that appear to explain the relative success  of some firms, including Goldman Sachs, during this crisis
  3 What explains this remarkable recovery in risky asset prices? Three factors seem to  have been important, all of which can be traced to policy actions by the authorities:  • First, the rate at which the future cashflows on risky assets are discounted has  fallen due to lower short and long-term global real interest rates
  • Second, as fears of a repeat of the Great Depression have abated, the premium  that investors require to compensate for this risk – the risk premium – has  fallen, boosting expected future cashflows on risky assets
  This is the high road to reform – for example, higher buffers of capital and liquidity  and higher standards of risk management
  This is the high road to reform – for example, higher buffers of capital and liquidity  and higher standards of risk management
 For a risk shared was a risk halved – perhaps more than halved, given the  magic of diversification
 So too did their risk management strategies
 How so?  Banks entered the crisis with a large portfolio of risky assets
 Bank A faces counterparty risk on Bank B
  Counterparty risk is not just unknown; it is almost unknowable
 It is little wonder participants took fright  as both institutions came under stress, fearful not so much of direct counterparty risk,  but of indirect counterparty risks emanating from elsewhere in the network
 Risk models blossomed, with Value-at-Risk (VaR)  and stress-testing providing seductively precise outputs
  This evidence is discouraging from a systemic risk perspective
34 With richer  data on network topology, calibrated simulation models could help gauge financial  institutions’ marginal contribution to systemic risk
  Risk managers are of course known for their pessimistic streak
 But risk management models have during this crisis proved  themselves wrong in a more fundamental sense
 Failed the authorities who had relied – perhaps over-relied – on  the signal it provided about financial firms’ risk management capabilities
  The Golden Decade  To understand the recent failures in risk management, some history is instructive
  Prior to the current financial crisis, the previous two low tide marks for the financial  system and risk management were the stock market crash of October 1987 and the  failure of the hedge fund LTCM in September 1998
 Both prompted a sea-change in  risk management practices and technologies
  The October 1987 crash in many respects marked the birth of Value at Risk (VaR) as  a key risk management tool in financial firms
 By 1996, they had published their  methodology and the detail of the parameterisation of their risk models
 In 1998  RiskMetrics Group, an independent for-profit business, spun off the JP Morgan  methodology and began offering consultancy services to the risk management  community
 We were experiencing a second wave of technological  revolution in risk management
 At the same time as returns were being boosted by bigger balance sheets  and financed by higher leverage, risk was being held in check by a shift in the  technological frontier of risk management
 Risk modelling became high fashion for the pointy-heads, haute-couture for  the anoraks
 In the face of these falls, risk management systems across  virtually all institutions have been found badly wanting
 Today, managers of risk – the  authorities just as much as banks – find themselves struggling to preserve their  dignity, with risk management systems a combination of sack-cloth and fig-leaf
  6 Diagnosing the Market Failures  So what were the failures, specifically of stress-testing and other risk management  tools, that contributed to this credit boom and subsequent bust? It is useful to try and  identify the micro-economic friction – the market failure – that was the root cause of  these risk management problems
 Perhaps ten years  is the threshold heuristic for risk managers
 The  degree of under-pricing of risk is large and is larger for options designed to protect  against tail risks (lower strike prices)
6   These network uncertainties make it tremendously difficult for risk managers to  identify and price, and hence manage, balance sheet risk
 First, internally, through the relationship  between risk managers and the risk-takers within financial firms; and second,  externally, in the relationship between financial firms and the authorities
 If the ex-post failure of an institution risks destabilising the    9  The KPMG survey of risk managers in October 2008 pointed to a similar conclusion, as does the  FSA consultation paper on stress-testing published in December 2008
 These are topsy-turvy incentives from a public policy perspective, with  risk management discipline weakest among those whom society would wish it to be  strongest
 The timeconsistency problem, and its associated negative consequences for risk management,  was real ahead of crisis
  When risks materialised outside of calibrated distributions, risk models provided little  guidance in identifying, pricing and hence managing them
 The breakdown of risk models is itself likely to have  contributed importantly to crisis dynamics
  But when risk shifted, many insurers have suffered large-scale losses as premia have  adjusted and investors have scrambled to hedge
 Risk models –  or the failure thereof – have played their part in generating these foggy outcomes
 See also Counterparty Risk Management Group (2008) for other useful suggestions
 As after the previous two episodes of systemic failure, in October  1987 and August 1998, a third wave of technological transformation in the standards  of risk management is now needed as a matter of priority
 These measures involve a  greater degree of engagement both between risk managers and senior management  within firms, and between financial firms and the authorities
 These measures would not prevent a next time – nor should they – but they might help make risk management roughly right
