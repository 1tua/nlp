 There are both positives and negatives from the shift in working practices that has taken place this year and the balance of these is likely itself to shift over time
  The Effects on Productivity and Output Given these shifts, some of which seem likely to prove durable, what impact might they have had on workers’ and businesses’ economic contribution – that is to say, their productivity (the amount done per hour worked) and their overall output (productivity multiplied by working hours)? In short, how has this shift in working practices affected working capacity of the economy? A number of empirical studies have looked at the effects of home working on productivity
 Even if the amount workers produce each hour has fallen, as evidence and anecdote tentatively suggests, this need not imply workers’ overall economic contribution has fallen
 For example, studies have found that working from home is positively associated with perceived autonomy and this, in turn, has positive spillover effects to our job satisfaction and levels of stress
  If home-working is broadly neutral in its impact on our economic contribution, but positive for our welfare, this suggests it is win-win, or at worst draw-win
  To give one example, walking has been found in studies to be positive for creativity, by freeing our minds from its office constraints and exposing our senses to different stimuli
 It was whether Mrs Thatcher (the then-Prime Minister) had recently suffered a bad byelection result
 This was bad news
 For UK households these amount to over £200 billion and for UK companies around £100 billion
 To this day, I believe that if greater amounts had been injected then – perhaps £100 billion? - UK banks would have been more willing to lend and the recovery would have been less anaemic
[21] The Basel 3 reforms eventually resulted in significant increases in the amounts of capital banks held; the introduction of an international regime for leverage and liquidity; a capital surcharge for the world’s “super-spreader” banks; and a system of countercyclical capital regulation to modulate credit cycles
 That risked making a bad situation worse, a complexity problem squared rather than halved
 The bad news is that the vast majority of these loans would not have been made at that speed without a 100% guarantee from Government
 And that is why a deeper consideration of monetary and financial stability implications is paramount today
 The Governor’s eyebrows were, in a way, a primitive form of emoji: sterling crisis – sad face, bad pre-MPC presentation – very sad face
 The bad is that the same surveys suggest only around a quarter of the public believe the Bank explains its actions and decisions in ways they understand
 The economic news has not all been positive
 Where Next for the Economy? The key question, at this juncture, is what happens next? Will the positive momentum of the past few months continue or was this a false dawn? Will the resilience of the consumer, or the reticence of companies, win out? Is the economic glass nine-tenths full or one tenth empty? Such is the uncertainty, it would be imprudent to make confident predictions about the shape of the recovery from here - which is one reason why, contrary to some commentary, I have not done so
 Yet negative media headlines outnumbered positives by many multiples
 Positive economic news was media-filtered into an extreme negative event
 This filtering of good news, and accentuation of the bad, is a familiar pattern of human behaviour at times of stress and uncertainty
 It also means households and businesses would be positively surprised if the MPC’s projections were to materialise
 If that condition was satisfied, any decision on negative rates would then depend on whether the balance of costs and benefits from using this tool was positive and whether this cost/benefit balance favoured negative rates over other monetary tools
 At the same time, it is important the unexpectedly positive progress the economy has made so far this year is not overlooked
 This positive news has received less attention than it deserves, both on its own terms and because of what it may tell us about the economy’s resilience to future shocks
 A propensity to dismiss good news and dwell on bad? To catastrophize about the future? The sense of events being beyond our control? These are the psychological symptoms of anxiety
9  That means balance in how the economic outlook is described, acknowledging good news as well as bad, contemplating upside as well as downside scenarios, taking positive signals (as well as some comfort) from the resilience shown so far
 In the UK recently, this has been a good news/bad news story
 The bad news has been the subdued performance of pay over much of that period – the weakest pay performance the UK has experienced since at least the Boer War
 Other definitions of recovery would of course suggest different amounts/periods of job creation, but it remains true that the current phase of job creation is high by historical standards
 Comparing the past 10 years as a whole, real pay today is lower at every point along the wage distribution and, with the exception of the bottom decile, by broadly similar amounts of around 5% (Chart 10)

 By contrast, expected responses to a deal scenario are all positive
 The US has low levels of unemployment and, courtesy of a progressive tightening of policy over recent years, a nowpositive – if still low – real interest rate
 In part, the deficits reflect the how well (or, rather, badly) economic material is conveyed to the general public
 And in part they reflect how well (badly) the public are able to digest this material
 And the Townhall visits, while not making me a super-forecaster, have thereby hopefully made me a slightly less bad one
 This is a “good news/bad news” story
 A century ago, public utterances by the Governor of the Bank of England amounted to one after-dinner speech each year to a well-watered set of City of London bankers
 To start with the positives, there is concrete evidence of the improved central bank communications having improved the functioning of financial markets, the forecasting performance of economists and even the reporting of the media on the economy
 The two, unsurprisingly, are positively correlated after the referendum
 But both are important for good ideas to emerge and for bad ideas to submerge
 It is a cocktail of expert and non-expert opinion, comprising diversity and deliberation in equal measure, that cause good ideas to flourish and bad ones to perish
 Just before the 2016 referendum on EU membership, Professor Anand Menon of King’s College London was explaining to an audience in Newcastle that, in the view of most economists, leaving the EU would be bad for their economic health
 This is done in both standard units of measurement (money amounts and percentages) and in non-standard units (welfare and well-being)
 This impact is shown on both a “money amount” and “percentage of income” basis
 The lion’s share of this boost resulted from the positive impact of looser policy on jobs and wages
 27 If we look at money amounts, rather than percentages, the balance of benefits is significantly more uneven
 26  The ‘money amount’ numbers that follow in this section refer to real income, defined in 2013 prices
 This analysis suggests that, with few exceptions, the impact of looser monetary policy on different cohorts of society has been positive and significant in income and wealth terms
 Another way of making this point is to  28  Though a notable feature of the UK’s recovery has been that, notwithstanding the positive effects of monetary policy, the real income of younger people has fallen further and recovered more slowly than older age groups (Haldane (2016))
 Debt is bad for household well-being, as others have found
 I take the key empirical conclusions to be:  The material loosening of UK monetary policy after 2007 has had a significantly positive effect on employment, income and wealth, without which average living standards in the UK would be materially lower
 This would identify the channels and the amounts by which a significant change in monetary policy affected people’s finances (income, wealth) and wider well-being (employment and financial security)
45  On a broad estimate, this annual cost amounts to around £2
 As we might expect, there are large differences in both the channels and scale of impact across these three cohorts, though in each case the net effect is strongly positive
 For example, the loosening of monetary policy in the case study was positive for most households
 For example, if this tightening came in response to a stronger economy, and helped avoid inflation overshooting its target requiring higher-still interest rates, its effects are likely to be positive too
 A disaggregated analysis can be used to help decompose the ways and means and amounts by which different sets of households have been affected by monetary policy
uk/speeches 4 4 A Story with One “i” What explains this extra-ordinary inflexion point in the history of economic growth and living standards? So fundamental is this question to so much of social and economic history that, understandably, it has attracted huge amounts of empirical, historical, social and theoretical research
 Even prior to the Industrial Revolution, economies experienced notable periods of strongly positive growth

 This means that, if technological unemployment is to be avoided, positive effects on productivity, goods and jobs will also have to be commensurately larger

 Exceptional amounts of central bank money have once again been created during the Covid crisis to maintain borrowing costs at low levels

 Some of these agglomeration benefits may themselves arise from having a diverse economic eco-system, as this enables positive spillovers between sectors and skills within an area
 They show a positive, statistically significant relationship
 And they may have influenced the amount of investment and innovation undertaken by firms and hence the aggregate demand curve (Aghion et al (2005))
 Although they capture subtly different dimensions of market power, there is a weakly positive relationship between measures of mark-up and market concentration at the sector level (Chart 4), which is statistically  6  De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) use a dataset that largely includes publicly-traded companies, but there are also some privately held firms
  11  While the positive unconditional correlation between average firm-level mark-ups and concentration at the sector level shown in Chart 4 is not statistically significant, a regression of individual firm-level mark-ups on market concentration in their sector (at the two-digit SIC level) shows a statistically significant positive relationship when we include firm and time fixed effects
 On the one hand, if highly productive ‘superstar’ firms, benefitting from network economies of scale and scope, have become more dominant, then higher mark-ups could be the side-effect of a positive supply shock in the economy
 If we look at the relationship between productivity and mark-ups across UK-listed firms, there is evidence of a positive relationship with TFP but no significant relationship with labour productivity (Table 2, columns 3 and 4)
 The relationship is, as we expect, a positive one
 24  Consistent with that, and taken at face value, there is a positive correlation between estimates of the US natural rate of interest and (the inverse) of global mark-ups since 1980 (Chart 17)
 This makes it optimal to do a greater amount of (now less costly) output-smoothing in the face of trade-off inducing shocks in the optimal policy rule
 This means the tightening of credit conditions  2  In practice borrowing behaviour is likely to be driven by several other factors, such as expectations of future earnings, access to finance and the amount of collateral with which to borrow against
 If the aggregate impact of looser monetary policy on the economy is positive, what about its distributional impact across regions? In this simple setting, lower interest rates boost the incomes of net borrowers in Red Car region, while reducing the income of net savers in Blue Car region
 One important determinant of a firm’s efficiency is the amount it invests in machines and technology - its physical capital stock
 In interest-rate equivalent terms, this amounted to a monetary stimulus worth around 7 percentage points
 But they have since fallen across every region in the UK since 2011 and by roughly similar amounts, on average 3 percentage points (Chart 12a)
 Over five years, the incremental spending amounts to an extra £23 billion
 In the end, workers are interested in the purchasing power of their pay, not its money amount
 This suggests unionisation is positive for pay growth and (statistically and economically) significant
 On the cyclical side, there remains a significant degree of uncertainty around the amount of slack in the economy
 But growth was not confined to these sectors, with virtually all sectors making a positive contribution to productivity growth
 There is a positive and statistically-significant relationship
 Nonetheless, the positive impact of higher interest rates on aggregate productivity is significantly tempered by the bankruptcy of some high-leverage, high-productivity companies

 The main conclusion from this work was that, under conservative assumptions about likely economic costs, there were positive economic benefits to society from a sizeable increase in the capital banks were required to maintain
 But by making the financial system more resilient to future shocks, it may also reduce the tail risk of bad macroeconomic outcomes
 So what have we learned over the past decade about the likely magnitude of these parameters? The Benefits of Higher Capital Requirements The assumptions underpinning the marginal benefits of higher capital in the LEI study were as follows: banking crises occur, on average, once every 20-25 years; the median estimate of the cumulative discounted costs of a crisis is around 60% of annual pre-crisis GDP; each percentage point increase in the capital ratio reduces the probability of a banking crisis by a smaller amount, ranging from 1
 On average, lending growth has been positive over this period, consistent with Cecchetti (2014)
 RWCR & LR: Require small fraction of liabilities to be non-runnable equity but a small amount relative to illiquid assets
 For example, a 1/N or unweighted asset allocation heuristic (Benartzi and Thaler (2001)), which allocates an equal amount of wealth to each of the assets in one’s portfolio, has been found to outperform more complex strategies such as Markowitz’s (1952) mean-variance optimisation in out-of-sample tests, unless the sample size is very large
 In other words, the balance of marginal benefits to costs becomes notably less positive when using a singular  deposit freezes and bank holidays
 Collateralised borrowing leads to externalities because individual borrowers do not internalise the fact that increasing debt in good times raises the likelihood they will be forced to sell assets following adverse shocks, pushing prices lower, tightening collateral constraints and exacerbating downturns
 Additionally, the growth of passive investments may have both positive and negative effects on volatility: they decrease yield volatility on average, but can increase the likelihood of large dislocations after shocks
 The haircuts in question are the amount of  collateral a borrower places with the lender over and above the face value of borrowing
 Liquidity has positive spillover effects or  externalities; liquidity is a public good
 Liquidity then has negative  spillovers, imposing negative externalities; illiquidity is a public bad
 The greater the  concentration within the financial system, the greater the potential for systemic collapse as larger banks  spread a disproportionate amount of financial pain around a densely networked financial system
  Hot heads make for bad decisions, frozen ears for uncomfortable ones
 By that  metric, the contribution of equity markets to economic growth in the US, Europe and Asia has been static, at  best mildly positive, during the course of this century
 In general, the relationship between volatility and  correlation is positive
 This excessive discounting implied that some firms were rejecting positive net present  value (NPV) projects
 First,  managers would reject a positive-NPV project if that lowered earnings below quarterly consensus  expectations
  So short-termism implies that projects with positive returns, or a relatively short payback, may be  misperceived as being negative return or having a relatively lengthy payback
 In other words, a NPV-positive project would be  resoundingly rejected
 Any imbalance between the rate at which international capital is  distributed and absorbed may spillover to global capital markets
 Reducing these spillovers may require a  rethink of the rules of the international financial system
  These surges in foreign capital flows, and associated asset market spillovers, are far from new
   While seemingly modest in index terms, the implied portfolio reallocations amount to very sizable  portfolio equity flows
 Recently, these  measures have included:   In Hong Kong, the authorities imposed a cap on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and a maximum loan  amount on certain properties, alongside an increase in stamp duty on sales in October 2009
 This is  consistent with the economic growth literature emphasising the positive, two-way relationship between  financial deepening and economic growth (Levine (2005))
   (b) The Evolution of Financial Depth  Theory would predict a positive, two-way relationship between financial depth and economic development
 The correlation is positive and reasonably strong: GDP per capita accounts for almost half of the  cross-sectional variation in the market capitalisation-to-GDP ratio
   In money terms, the stock market capitalisation of the G20 emerging markets rises to around $300  trillion in 2050, while the G20 advanced economies amount to $170 trillion
 In practice, frictions in the  functioning of these markets mean that asset market spillovers seem very likely to persist
 A reduction in those capital market frictions would tend to lower the asset market  spillover costs of the BFSP problem
    This visual evidence can be formalised by constructing some Type I (false positive) and Type II (missed  crisis) error estimates for the same 33-bank panel
 Market measures provide both  fewer false positives and more reliable advance warnings of future banking distress
 And when nature is cruel and times are bad, they offer the downswing  (bankruptcy costs) benefits of equity
 That is roughly £70 billion, or around the  amount of external capital UK banks raised during the crisis
  There is also evidence of them arising from coordination failures, which generate spillover effects  across banks and countries

High bank ability and a good macro state increase the  probability of positive asset returns
 That is, when the macro state is bad, assets turn out to be bad,  irrespective of bankers’ ability
 If the asset  is good, banks make a profit (normalised to be a negligible amount)
 If the asset is bad, banks face  a loss of -1
 If an  asset turns out to be bad, banks can hide negative earnings in the short run by engaging in risky  policies to boost returns – in effect, engaging in risk illusion
 If returns are low, under a risky policy banks can increase short term  earnings with some positive probability, but must incur a long term loss; while under a tight policy,  banks can accept low short term earnings for sure now, avoiding losses in the future
 When the  asset is bad, two strategies are possible
 If a bank chooses a risky (superscript ݎ (policy, it obtains  ݑ௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ ൌ ሺ1െߛሻሾെሺ1െܽሻ െ ܿሿ ൅ ݌ߛ௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ, 6  where a proportion ݈ of all banks also set a risky policy
 5,6 When the loan is bad, setting a tight (superscript ݐ (policy yields  ݑ௧ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ ൌ ሺ1െߛሻሺെ1ሻ ൅ ݌ߛ௧ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ,  as the probability of a loss is unity under a tight policy and the bank obtains reputation ݌௧ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ
 When others are posting positive earnings, the reputational loss  from foreclosing and taking losses is that much greater
 But one bank’s announcement of positive earnings encourages others  to announce positive earnings by setting risky policies too
 In Rajan’s model this strategic  complementarity between banks generates multiple equilibria: in sufficiently good states, banks  coordinate on risky policies (“credit booms”), while in bad states they coordinate on tight policies  (“credit crunches”)
 6 ݌௥ሺߠ݈ ,ሻ is the probability assigned by the market of the bank being high ability, conditional on the bank setting a risky  policy (unobserved by the market), the asset being bad, the macro state being ߠ and proportion ݈ other banks also setting  risky policies

  Using (1) it follows that the threshold level of fundamentals above which banks set risky policies is  (a) increasing in the long-term cost of extending bad credit ܿ, and (b) decreasing in relative  reputational concerns ߛ ,or ݀כߠ כߠ݀ ,0/݀ܿ ൐  
9  Without frictions, bad loans are liquidated immediately, allowing  new assets to be originated next period to unencumbered borrowers
 By contrast, extending credit  to bad risks eventually results in balance sheet impairment for both borrowers and lenders
 In particular,  if fundamentals happen to be close to the switching threshold, a further positive shock will lead all  firms to coordinate on the high risk-taking strategy
 But during the bust, when  the macro state turns bad, the dispersion of banks’ earnings should increase as low ability types  crystallise losses while high ability types do not
 Credit Cycle Spillovers This empirical evidence to date, operating at a macro-economic level, is consistent with the model  in Section 2: a credit cycle is clearly discernible; its frequency is different and its amplitude larger  than the business cycle; and its fluctuations may exacerbate the business cycle
 But the model also  has implications at a micro-economic level, arising from strategic complementarities, or spillover  effects, across firms
 In this section we consider empirical evidence on such credit spillover effects
 We replicated their results: lagged real credit growth (up to five or six  years) was jointly significant in positively contributing to the probability of there being a subsequent banking crisis, and  robust across sub-samples pre and post WWII
 Specifically,  individual banks may fail to internalise the reputational externalities their lending actions impose on  others
 That is because bankspecific actions will not, by themselves, internalise the spillovers that arise across banks over the  credit cycle
 So if  Bank 2 announces positive earnings, it must be because the macro state is good
 But given this,  Bank 1 does not want to signal low ability by playing {Tight} when it makes a bad loan since doing  so would be taken by the market to imply low ability
 If the spillover from Bank 2’s actions to the  market’s assessment of the macro state is strong enough, {Tight, Tight} may no longer be an  equilibrium
  Credit spillovers occur across borders as well as across banks
 For example, judgements on local credit conditions determine the amounts of capital to  be held by international banks on their exposures in those countries

 This  structural trend in finance has been shown to have contributed positively to growth in the  whole-economy (Wadhwani (2010))
  To illustrate this rather starkly, consider a hedged bet placed back in 1900, which involved  going long by £100 in financial sector equities and short in non-financial equities by the same  amount
 This amounts  to relating growth in GDP to growth in labour input and in various capital services (from  buildings, vehicles, computers and other resources)
 This meant it was capital-efficient for banks to bundle loans  into tradable structured credit products for onward sale
5   Tranched structured products, such as CDOs (collateralised debt obligations) and CLOs  (collateralised loan obligations), generate a similar payoff profile for investors to sub-prime  loans, yielding a positive return in stable states of the world – apparent alpha – and a large  negative return in adverse states
 But this was typically more than offset  by losses once bad states materialised
 So provided this model adequately captures  risk, these estimates ought to risk-adjust returns across the different business lines, allocating  greater amounts of capital to riskier activities
7  The resulting money amount is an estimate of the reduction in banks’  funding costs which arises from the perceived government subsidy
13 Under this framework, the optimal amount of pollution  control is found by equating the marginal social benefits of pollution-control and the marginal  private costs of this control
  13  the relationship is positively sloped, with size and diversity increasing income variability, not  smoothing it
 Again, if anything, these relationships are positively  sloped, with larger, more diversified banks suffering proportionally greater losses
 There are no examples during this crisis of financial institutions beyond $100  billion being resolved without serious systemic spillovers
 Against that backdrop, it is understandable that restrictions on scale  _____________________________________________________________________________  42 Washington Mutual, with assets of around $300bn, was resolved by FDIC, but was perceived by many to have  caused systemic spillovers
 For that reason, it is possible that no amount of  capital or liquidity may ever be quite enough
 In other  words, there is both positive (at short horizons) and negative (at longer horizons)  serial correlation in market prices
 Global banks' net  income in 2009 is expected to be around $60 billion, compared to a loss of roughly  that amount in 2008
  On the back of this positive news, the authorities in some countries have begun  withdrawing extraordinary levels of support
 For while the flow of news over  the past year has been positive, some of the stock problems which were the root cause  of the crisis remain intact
 But if a positive profit surprise  comes along, this windfall should be pocketed, front-loading the path to higher capital  without harming lending and growth - an opportunistic approach to stabilisation

 A network which, like the little girl with the curl,  when the going was good was very, very good – but when it turned bad was horrid
 It  suggests a positive relationship between bank size and pre-crisis expectations of    32 For example, Pikitch et al (2004)
 That report should contain information sufficient to  answer the question “How much could JPM lose if tomorrow turns out to be a  relatively bad day?”  With this as the top-down edict, it is perhaps unsurprising that JP Morgan were an  early-developer and early-adopter of VaR
 In  some markets growth was little short of explosive, with the rise in volumes  outstanding in the CDS market making Moore’s Law look positively sluggish
 In the face of these falls, risk management systems across  virtually all institutions have been found badly wanting
5  In financial networks, these externalities are  often referred to as contagion or spillovers
 There have been many examples of such  spillover during this crisis, with Lehman Brothers’ failure a particularly painful one
 This is simply a variant of the old adage that if you owe the bank a small  amount it is your problem, a large amount it is theirs
 These days, if a bank owes a  small amount it is their problem, a large amount it is the authorities
 This will better enable firms to assess the spillover and  contagion consequences of their own and others’ actions, so helping  internalise to some degree the network externality problems which have been  prevalent through this crisis
